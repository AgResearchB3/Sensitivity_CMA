abstract = {A computer-based system (CLIMEX) is described which enables the prediction of an animal's potential relative abundance and distribution around the world, using biological data and observations on geographical distribution. Separate indices describe the potential of a population firstly to grow, and secondly to persist through climatically unfavourable periods. The indices are then combined to give an "Ecoclimatic Index", which describes the overall climatic favourability of any location for that animal. The system is applicable in such areas as quarantine, biological control, pest management and epidemiology. Examples from veterinary entomology, using the ticks Boophilus microplus, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and Amblyomma variegatum, and the flies Haematobia spp., are used to illustrate how CLIMEX can provide insight into likely changes in population size within years, between years and between places. The caveats usually associated with climatic matching are reiterated. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

@article{Wallentin2012,
abstract = {In this article, we introduce a conceptual framework for systematic identification and assessment of sources of uncertainty in simulation models. This concept builds on a novel typology of uncertainty in model validation and extends the GIScience research focus on uncertainty in spatial data to uncertainty in simulation modelling. Such a concept helps a modeller to interpret and handle uncertainty in order to efficiently optimise a model and better understand simulation results. To illustrate our approach, we apply the proposed framework for uncertainty assessment to the TREE LIne Model (TREELIM), an individual-based model that simulates forest succession at the alpine tree line. Using this example, uncertainty is identified in the modelling workflow during conceptualisation, formalisation, parameterisation, analysis and validation. With help of a set of indicators we quantify the emerging uncertainties and assess the overall model uncertainty as a function of all occurring sources of uncertainty. An understanding of the sources of uncertainty in an ecological model proves beneficial for: (1) developing a structurally valid model in a systematic way; (2) deciding if further refinement of the conceptual model is beneficial for the modelling purpose; and (3) interpreting the overall model uncertainty by understanding its sources. Our approach results in a guideline for assessing uncertainty in the validation of simulation models in a feasible and defensible way, and thus functions as a toolbox for modellers. We consider this work as a contribution towards a general concept of uncertainty in spatially explicit simulation models.},

@article{McKinney2004,
abstract = {It is commonly asserted that exotic species promote the homogenization of biological communities. However, theoretical evidence implies that exotic species may often have the opposite effect, of differentiating biological communities where different exotic species become established in different areas. Furthermore, few empirical studies have directly measured the homogenizing effects of exotics. In this study, I used the plant inventories of 20 localities in the United States to measure whether exotic plant increased the similarity of those localities. I calculated Jaccard's index of similarity (JI) for exotic species and then for native species to see if the exotic JI was consistently higher when comparing two localities. I found that JI for both exotic and native species decline exponentially with increasing distance and latitude separation between localities so that localities that share many native species also tend to share many exotic species. More importantly, in nearly half of the pairwise locality comparisons (87 of 190), the (JI(exotic)/JI(native)) ratio is less than one, indicating a slight tendency for exotic species to differentiate rather than homogenize the localities analyzed. Also, the pattern of differentiation versus homogenization is strongly related to exotic species richness. When both localities have relatively few exotics, there is a clear tendency for exotics to produce biotic differentiation (JI(exotic)/JI(native) {\textless} 1). Much of this pattern seems related to the right-skewed frequency distribution of the geographic ranges of exotic species. As with native species, most exotics occur in few localities so there is a high probability that localities with low numbers of exotic species will share very few, if any, of those exotics. As exotic richness increases, the homogenizing effects become increasingly pronounced.},

abstract = {The trade in woody plants for planting (WP4P) is a major pathway for the introduction of alien tree pests and diseases into Europe. Pest risk analyses are important tools to prevent such introductions, but they target recognised pests, their hosts and commodities that are likely to vector them. Moreover, the perception of risk partially depends on expert judgement. Our aim was to provide an objective assessment of the likelihood of establishment and potential sources of invasive species. We analysed distribution data for 1009 invertebrate pests and pathogens of woody hosts in 344 regions. Countries and regions with similar pest assemblages were identified for each organism group using hierarchical cluster analysis and the likelihood of establishment of those species was calculated as the frequency of each species in countries within the cluster containing EU and EFTA countries ("EU countries"). Meaningful European clusters were formed for all organism groups, except oomycetes, and species were ranked by risk to each EU country. The non-EU regions with the most similar pest assemblages to the EU are the Balkan countries, Japan, Kazakhstan, New Zealand, Turkey, Ukraine, parts of China, Russia and the USA, and EPPO countries, indicating that these may be the origin of new pests and pathogens. The quality of the assessment of the likelihood of establishment depends on the quality of distribution data for pests and pathogens, but data quality varies between countries and organism groups and records are often historical. For example, the recent increase in trade and the similar climate in which WP4P for the EU market are grown in China indicates that this may be an important source of new invaders, but this was not suggested by our analysis. Moreover, most pest species in our database are recorded in one or more EU countries and the risk of these species primarily comes from within the EU. Future studies should therefore take the potential spread and establishment of these species in Europe, as well as recent changes in world trade patterns into account. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper shows that when classifications are based solely on data describing individual objects to be classified, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is an incoherent measure of performance, in the sense that the measure itself depends on the classifier being measured. It significantly extends earlier work by showing that this incoherence is not a consequence of a cost-based interpretation of misclassifications, but is a fundamental property of the area under the curve itself. The paper also shows that if additional information, such as the class assignments of other objects, is taken into account when making a classification, then the area under the curve is a coherent measure, although in those circumstances it makes an assumption which is seldom if ever appropriate. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Alien insects are increasingly being dispersed around the world through international trade, causing a multitude of negative environmental impacts and billions of dollars in economic losses annually. Border controls form the last line of defense against invasions, whereby inspectors aim to intercept and stop consignments that are contaminated with harmful alien insects. In Europe, member states depend on one another to prevent insect introductions by operating a first point of entry rule - controlling goods only when they initially enter the continent. However, ensuring consistency between border control points is difficult because there exists no optimal inspection strategy. For the first time, we developed a method to quantify the volume of agricultural trade that should be inspected for quarantine insects at border control points in Europe, based on global agricultural trade of over 100 million distinct origin-commodity-species-destination pathways. This metric was then used to evaluate the performance of existing border controls, as measured by border interception results in Europe between 2003 and 2007. Alarmingly, we found significant gaps between the trade pathways that should be inspected and actual number of interceptions. Moreover, many of the most likely introduction pathways yielded none or very few insect interceptions, because regular interceptions are only made on only a narrow range of pathways. European countries with gaps in border controls have been invaded by higher numbers of quarantine alien insect species, indicating the importance of proper inspections to prevent insect invasions. Equipped with an optimal inspection strategy based on the underlying risks of trade, authorities globally will be able to implement more effective and consistent border controls.},

Novel ecosystems (also termed 'emerging ecosystems') result when species occur in combinations and relative abundances that have not occurred previously within a given biome. Key characteristics are novelty, in the form of new species combinations and the potential for changes in ecosystem functioning, and human agency, in that these ecosystems are the result of deliberate or inadvertent human action. As more of the Earth becomes transformed by human actions, novel ecosystems increase in importance, but are relatively little studied. Either the degradation or invasion of native or 'wild' ecosystems or the abandonment of intensively managed systems can result in the formation of these novel systems. Important considerations are whether these new systems are persistent and what values they may have. It is likely that it may be very difficult or costly to return such systems to their previous state, and hence consideration needs to be given to developing appropriate management goals and approaches.},

@article{Hulme2011,
abstract = {Most researchers working in applied ecology are aware that much of what is published in leading ecological and environmental science journals makes little difference to the day-to-day management of species and ecosystems (Nature 2007). In recent years, several editorials have made this point and attempted to identify a way forward to bridge ‘The Great Divide' (Born, Boreux {\{}{\&}{\}} Lawes 2009; Milner-Gulland et al. 2010; Memmott et al. 2010). The onus has largely been on the scientific community to communicate the value of its science more clearly, become increasingly involved in extension activities and, heaven forbid, step down from their ivory towers and get their hands dirty. Yet the reality is that many scientists are doing this already, several very successfully (Possingham 2009). A more serious concern is that academic journals are simply not the best medium to communicate practical messages to a wide audience who need specific solutions to particular problems that have to be delivered on a tight budget. We should not be surprised; much academic research aims to be innovative, internationally competitive and globally relevant – aims which are not always congruent with finding practical solutions. It is against these criteria that many editorial decisions regarding whether or not to accept a paper for publication are made. Irrespective of how much hand-wringing might take place among editors this situation is unlikely to change as publishers judge the viability of journals using bibliometric indices and numbers of institutional subscriptions. Yet, potentially there is another way. Communication is a two-way street, even if much of the academic traffic is heading in one direction with no clear destination. So how do scientific researchers hear about the concerns and needs of those tackling problems in the field? Surveys of stakeholders are certainly one way to confirm that they feel the scientific community is not listening to them (e.g. Andreu, Vil{\{}{\`{a}}{\}} {\{}{\&}{\}} Hulme 2009) but questionnaires do not address the problem. An alternative is to provide an opportunity within the pages of academic journals for non-standard pieces to be written by individuals who have a different perspective on what is needed in applied ecology research and whether the papers published in academic journals get anywhere near it. With this aim, the Journal of Applied Ecology launches its first ‘Practitioner's Perspective'. These ‘prick our conscience' pieces can be contributed by anyone who has a strong opinion on the current state of applied ecology research, whether academic or not, as long as they can provide an original perspective and a constructive way forward. Although practitioners have been identified as a distinct group of actors in applied ecology that ‘buy land, put up fences, set fires, put out fires, lobby politicians, negotiate with farmers, spray invasive weeds, poison rats and guard against poachers' (Nature 2007), we are not placing restrictions on who is or is not a ‘practitioner'. Thus, we welcome pieces from academics (at least those with a bit of dirt under their fingernails) as well as civil servants, environmental consultants, park managers and environmental lobbyists. The truth is we are unsure what to expect in terms of submissions under this new feature, hopefully provocative pieces from writers whose voices are rarely heard in our journal. To kick-start this initiative we have commissioned a few articles that might give a flavour of the pieces we would like to see published in the future. Our greatest challenge to date has been to prevent these pieces from becoming advertorials for the activities of NGOs, conservation groups or consultancies. This is certainly not what we want, but we do welcome examples of best practice that may not have made it into the wider academic literature. The first Practitioner's Perspective appears in this issue (Goulson et al. 2011) and illustrates the viewpoint of the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, although the lead author is a senior academic at Stirling University, UK. Hopefully, in addition to highlighting how science informs the conservation of bumblebees it will challenge readers to consider what more needs to be done. We encourage future submissions under Practitioner's Perspectives but please be sure to contact the Editors to discuss your piece beforehand. There is no prescribed structure to Practitioner's Perspectives apart from our hope that they will be thought-provoking and challenge the science community to consider the perspectives of those individuals addressing applied ecological issues. However, authors may wish to consider covering the activities of the individual or organization with regard to ecological management, the key issues they are addressing (see Sutherland et al. 2006, 2009 for a range of key questions), the extent to which applied ecological research has supported their activities (if at all), how future research might assist them to address ecological problems more effectively and how this might best be achieved (e.g. through greater dialogue, joint projects, new research techniques etc.).

abstract = {Even with no new introductions, the number of biological invasions in South Africa will increase as introduced species naturalise and become invasive. As of 2010 South Africa had {\&}{\#}126;8750 introduced plant taxa, 660 recorded as naturalised, 198 included in invasive species legislation, but only 64 subject to regular control (i.e. only widespread invaders are managed post-border). There is only one documented example of a successful eradication programme in continental South Africa - against the Mediterranean snail ({\textless}i/{\textgreater}Otala punctata{\textless}/i{\textgreater}) in Cape Town. Here we describe the establishment in 2008 of a unit funded by the Working for Water Programme as part of the South African National Biodiversity Institute's Invasive Species Programme (SANBI ISP) designed to (1) detect and document new invasions, (2) provide reliable and transparent post-border risk assessments and (3) provide the cross-institutional coordination needed to successfully implement national eradication plans. As of the end of 2012, the ISP had an annual budget of R36 million, employed 33 staff working across all nine provinces, supported 10 postgraduate students, hosted 35 interns (including those as part of a drive to collect DNA barcodes for all invasive taxa) and created over 50 000 days of work as part of government poverty alleviation programmes. The unit has worked towards full risk assessments for 39 plant taxa and has developed eradication plans for seven species; the unit is now helping implement these plans. By focusing on science-based management and policy, we argue that SANBI ISP can play a leading role in preventing introduced species from becoming widespread invaders.},

abstract = {Biological invasions are widely recognized as a major threat to biodiversity worldwide and are the focus of intense research by ecologists and substantial, multifaceted management initiatives. The human dimension of invasions is crucial, and we are pleased to see invasions receiving increasing attention from human geographers. In a recent paper in this journal, Warren (2007) acknowledges that invasions are hugely problematic and undesirable, but he questions key assumptions upon which interventions to deal with such problems are grounded. Notably, he argues that the conceptual foundations of the 'native/alien polarity' seem 'irredeemably fractured'. As an alternative to categorizing species as native or alien, he advocates, but does not elaborate on, an approach based on a 'damage criterion'. We agree with some of his arguments and concerns, but Warren (2007) dangerously oversimplifi es the full range of complex issues that confront researchers and managers dealing with biological invasions, and mis-represents both their operational premises and current modus operandi. First, we concur with Warren that 'we should not hate introduced species solely on the grounds of their attributed alien status'; that 'exotic introductions are often woven},

abstract = {1.Spatial climate variables are routinely used in species distribution models (SDMs) without accounting for the fact that they have been predicted with uncertainty, which can lead to biased estimates, erroneous inference and poor performances when predicting to new settings - e.g. under climate change scenarios. 2.We show how information on uncertainty associated with spatial climate variables can be obtained from climate data models. We then explain different types of uncertainty (i.e. classical and Berkson error), and use two statistical methods that incorporate uncertainty in climate variables into SDMs by means of: (1) hierarchical modelling; and (2) simulation-extrapolation. 3.We used simulation to study the consequences of failure to account for measurement error. When uncertainty in explanatory variables was not accounted for, we found that coefficient estimates were biased and the SDM had a loss of statistical power. Further, this bias led to biased predictions when projecting change in distribution under climate change scenarios. The proposed errors-in-variables methods were less sensitive to these issues. 4.We also fit the proposed models to real data (presence/absence data on the Carolina wren, Thryothorus ludovicianus), as a function of temperature variables. 5.The proposed framework allows for many possible extensions and improvements to SDMs. If information on the uncertainty of spatial climate variables is available to researchers, we recommend: (1) first identify the type of uncertainty; (2) consider whether any spatial autocorrelation or independence assumptions are required; and (3) attempt to incorporate the uncertainty into the SDM through established statistical methods and their extensions.

However, when dealing with highly skewed datasets, Precision-Recall (PR) curves give a more informative picture of an algorithm's performance. We show that a deep connection exists between ROC space and PR space, such that a curve dominates in ROC space if and only if it dominates in PR space. A corollary is the notion of an achievable PR curve, which has properties much like the convex hull in ROC space; we show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that optimize the area under the ROC curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the PR curve.},

abstract = {Species moved by human activities beyond the limits of their native geographic ranges into areas in which they do not naturally occur (termed aliens) can cause a broad range of significant changes to recipient ecosystems; however, their impacts vary greatly across species and the ecosystems into which they are introduced. There is therefore a critical need for a standardised method to evaluate, compare, and eventually predict the magnitudes of these different impacts. Here, we propose a straightforward system for classifying alien species according to the magnitude of their environmental impacts, based on the mechanisms of impact used to code species in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Global Invasive Species Database, which are presented here for the first time. The classification system uses five semi-quantitative scenarios describing impacts under each mechanism to assign species to different levels of impact-ranging from Minimal to Massive-with assignment corresponding to the highest level of deleterious impact associated with any of the mechanisms. The scheme also includes categories for species that are Not Evaluated, have No Alien Population, or are Data Deficient, and a method for assigning uncertainty to all the classifications. We show how this classification system is applicable at different levels of ecological complexity and different spatial and temporal scales, and embraces existing impact metrics. In fact, the scheme is analogous to the already widely adopted and accepted Red List approach to categorising extinction risk, and so could conceivably be readily integrated with existing practices and policies in many regions.},

abstract = {1 Disturbance may cause community composition across sites to become more or less homogenous, depending on the importance of different processes involved in community assembly. In north-eastern North America and Europe local (alpha) diversity of forest plants is lower in forests growing on former agricultural fields (recent forests) than in older (ancient) forests, but little is known about the influence of land-use history on the degree of compositional differentiation among sites (beta diversity). 2 Here we analyse data from 1446 sites in ancient and recent forests across 11 different landscapes in north-eastern North America and Europe to demonstrate decreases in beta diversity and in the strength of species-environment relationships in recent vs. ancient forests. 3 The magnitude of environmental variability among sites did not differ between the two forest types. This suggests the difference in beta diversity between ancient and recent forests was not due to different degrees of environmental heterogeneity, but rather to dispersal filters that constrain the pool of species initially colonizing recent forests. 4 The observed effects of community homogenization and weakened relationships between species distributions and environmental gradients appear to persist for decades or longer. The legacy of human land-use history in spatial patterns of biodiversity may endure, both within individual sites and across sites, for decades if not centuries.},

abstract = {Proper hypothesis testing is the subject of much debate in ecology. According to studies in cognitive psychology, confirmation bias (a tendency to seek confirming evidence) and theory tenacity (persistent belief in a theory in spite of contrary evidence) pervasively influence actual problem solving and hypothesis testing, often interfering with effective testing of alternative hypotheses. On the other hand, these psychological factors play a positive role in the process of theory maturation by helping to protect and nurture a new idea until it is suitable for critical evaluation. As a theory matures it increases in empirical content and its predictions become more distinct. Efficient hypothesis testing is often not possible when theories are in an immature state, as is the case in much of ecology. Problem areas in ecology are examined in light of these considerations, including failure to publish negative results, misuses of mathematical models, confusion resulting from ambiguous terms (such as "diversity" and "niche"), and biases against new ideas.},

However, approaches and findings have remained largely controversial so far, calling for a unification of methods. Here, we build on a review of empirical studies of invasion to formalize a unifying framework that decomposes niche change into unfilling, stability, and expansion situations, taking both a pooled range and range-specific perspective on the niche, while accounting for climatic availability and climatic analogy. This framework provides new insights into the nature of climate niche shifts and our ability to anticipate invasions, and may help in guiding the design of experiments for assessing causes of niche changes. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Network technologies have facilitated the implementation of health services based on ubiquitous systems, allowing pervasive monitoring of patients in their daily activities without significantly interfering in their lifestyle. This event entails the need to ensure adequate management and security of healthcare environment networks. However, traffic monitoring became an arduous work, requiring autonomic mechanisms to describe the network's normal behavior. Thus, Digital Signature of Network Segment using Flow analysis(DSNSF) as a mechanism to assist the networks management through traffic characterization is introduced. For this purpose, three methods belonging to different groups of algorithms are used: the statistical procedure Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) metaheuristic and Holt'Winters forecasting method. These methods characterize the traffic into two distinct levels. The first one is the network infrastructure, which encompasses the entire network, including non-healthcare data from different sectors which compose an e-health environment. Profile creation about traffic used for monitoring of patients' vital and behavioral signs identifies the second level. Also, an approach for anomaly detection is proposed, which is able to recognize unusual events that may affect the proper operation of the services provided by the network.},

@article{Hulme2012,
abstract = {1. Many alien weeds pose significant environmental and/or economic threats across the globe, and methods to assess the potential risk of species introductions are key components in the management of plant invasions. Three broad approaches have been adopted in weed risk assessment: quantitative statistical models, semi-quantitative scoring and qualitative expert assessment. Yet, the effectiveness of these different approaches is rarely evaluated. By bringing together perspectives drawn from statistics, complexity theory, bioeconomics and cognitive psychology, this review presents the first interdisciplinary appraisal of whether weed risk assessment is a valuable tool in the management of plant invasions.2. Problems in obtaining an objective measure of the hazards posed by weeds, challenges of predicting complex hierarchical and nonlinear systems, difficulties in quantifying uncertainty and variability, as well as cognitive biases in expert judgement, all limit the utility of current risk assessment approaches. The accuracy of weed risk assessment protocols is usually insufficient, given inherent low base-rates even when the costs and benefits of decisions are taken into account, and implies that the predictive value of weed risk assessment is questionable.3. Current practices could be improved to address consistent hazard identification, encompass a hierarchy of spatio-temporal scales, incorporate uncertainty, generate realistic base-rates, and train risk assessors to limit cognitive biases. However, such refinements may still fail to predict weed risks any better than a knowledge of prior invasion history and quality of climate match.4. Alternative approaches include scenario planning that seeks qualitative inputs regarding hypothetical events to facilitate long-range planning using multiple alternatives each explicit in their treatment of uncertainty. This represents a change from prevention towards adaptive management where the difficulty in prediction is acknowledged and investment targets early detection, mitigation and management.5. Synthesis and applications. Scenario planning may be particularly suitable for weeds as they can be rapidly surveyed and have sufficiently long lag phases between naturalisation and invasion that early detection is often feasible. If integrated with assessments of ecosystem vulnerability to invasion and interventions to improve ecosystem resilience, it would deliver a robust post-border approach to invasive plant management. This approach would address threats from new introductions as well as ‘sleeper weeds' already present in a region.},

The procedure consists of starting with k groups which each consist of a single random point, and thereafter adding the points one after another to the group whose mean each point is nearest. After a point is added to a group, the mean of that group is adjusted so as to take account of the new point. Thus at each stage there are in fact k means, one for each group. After the sample is processed in this way, the points are classified on the basis of nearness to the final means. The portions which result tend to be fficient in the sense of having low within class variance. Applications are suggested for the problems of non-linear prediction, efficient communication, non-parametric tests of independence, similarity grouping, and automatic file construction. The extension of the methods to general metric spaces is indicated.},

abstract = {Predicting future species invasions presents significant challenges to researchers and government agencies. Simply considering the vast number of potential species that could invade an area can be insurmountable. One method, recently suggested, which can analyse large datasets of invasive species simultaneously is that of a self organising map (SOM), a form of artificial neural network which can rank species by establishment likelihood. We used this method to analyse the worldwide distribution of 486 fungal pathogens and then validated the method by creating a virtual world of invasive species in which to test the SOM. This novel validation method allowed us to test SOM's ability to rank those species that can establish above those that can't. Overall, we found the SOM highly effective, having on average, a 96-98{\%} success rate (depending on the virtual world parameters). We also found that regions with fewer species present (i.e. 1-10 species) were more difficult for the SOM to generate an accurately ranked list, with success rates varying from 100{\%} correct down to 0{\%} correct. However, we were able to combine the numbers of species present in a region with clustering patterns in the SOM, to further refine confidence in lists generated from these sparsely populated regions. We then used the results from the virtual world to determine confidences for lists generated from the fungal pathogen dataset. Specifically, for lists generated for Australia and its states and territories, the reliability scores were between 84-98{\%}. We conclude that a SOM analysis is a reliable method for analysing a large dataset of potential invasive species and could be used by biosecurity agencies around the world resulting in a better overall assessment of invasion risk.},

abstract = {Current sediment quality guidelines generally adopt a tiered approach in order to assess sediment quality more cost-effectively. The uncertainties involved in the tiered approach of an integrative assessment, however have not been quantified resulting in a risk of committing type I error or type II error at the final confirmatory stage. This study develops statistical criteria and guidelines for the sediment chemistry component of an integrative assessment of sediment quality. At the tier 1 screening stage, historical data or an initial survey is required to determine the minimum sample numbers that will be required to be representative of the study site. Understanding the guiding principles which have underpinned the setting of sediment quality criteria for contaminant is an important factor in tier 1 evaluations. To reduce cost and uncertainty in data, sampling should include the least number of samples necessary to minimise uncertainties by estimating the probability distribution function (which represents the variability of the natural environment at the location of concern), with subsequent application of kriging and sequential simulation methods on data obtained. Implementation of statistical criteria and guidelines in sediment quality assessments can provide a foundation for a further quantitative cost/benefit analysis and decrease the risk of committing type I and type II statistical errors at later classification stages.},

abstract = {Because invasive species threaten the integrity of natural ecosystems, a major goal in ecology is to develop predictive models to determine which species may become widespread and where they may invade. Indeed, considerable progress has been made in understanding the factors that influence the local pattern of spread for specific invaders and the factors that are correlated with the number of introduced species that have become established in a given region. However, few studies have examined the relative importance of multiple drivers of invasion success for widespread species at global scales. Here, we use a dataset of {\textgreater}5,000 presence/absence records to examine the interplay between climatic suitability, biotic resistance by native taxa, human-aided dispersal, and human modification of habitats, in shaping the distribution of one of the world's most notorious invasive species, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). Climatic suitability and the extent of human modification of habitats are primarily responsible for the distribution of this global invader. However, we also found some evidence for biotic resistance by native communities. Somewhat surprisingly, and despite the often cited importance of propagule pressure as a crucial driver of invasions, metrics of the magnitude of international traded commodities among countries were not related to global distribution patterns. Together, our analyses on the global-scale distribution of this invasive species provide strong evidence for the interplay of biotic and abiotic determinants of spread and also highlight the challenges of limiting the spread and subsequent impact of highly invasive species.},

abstract = {How and why organisms are distributed as they are has long intrigued evolutionary biologists. The tendency for species to retain their ancestral ecology has been demonstrated in distributions on local and regional scales, but the extent of ecological conservatism over tens of millions of years and across continents has not been assessed. Here we show that biome stasis at speciation has outweighed biome shifts by a ratio of more than 25:1, by inferring ancestral biomes for an ecologically diverse sample of more than 11,000 plant species from around the Southern Hemisphere. Stasis was also prevalent in transocean colonizations. Availability of a suitable biome could have substantially influenced which lineages establish on more than one landmass, in addition to the influence of the rarity of the dispersal events themselves. Conversely, the taxonomic composition of biomes has probably been strongly influenced by the rarity of species' transitions between biomes. This study has implications for the future because if clades have inherently limited capacity to shift biomes, then their evolutionary potential could be strongly compromised by biome contraction as climate changes.},

abstract = {Aim Biotic homogenization describes the process by which species invasions and extinctions increase the genetic, taxonomic or functional similarity of two or more biotas over a specified time interval. The study of biotic homogenization is a young and rapidly emerging research area in the budding field of conservation biogeography, and this paper aims to synthesize our current knowledge of this process and advocate a more systematic approach to its investigation. Methods Based on a comprehensive examination of the primary literature this paper reviews the process of biotic homogenization, including its definition, quantification, underlying ecological mechanisms, environmental drivers, the empirical evidence for different taxonomic groups, and the potential ecological and evolutionary implications. Important gaps in our knowledge are then identified, and areas of new research that show the greatest promise for advancing our current thinking on biotic homogenization are highlighted. Results Current knowledge of the patterns, mechanisms and implications of biotic homogenization is highly variable across taxonomic groups, but in general is incomplete. Quantitative estimates are almost exclusively limited to freshwater fishes and plants in the United States, and the principal mechanisms and drivers of homogenization remain elusive. To date research has focused on taxonomic homogenization, and genetic and functional homogenization has received inadequate attention. Trends over the past decade, however, suggest that biotic homogenization is emerging as a topic of greater research interest. Main conclusions My investigation revealed a number of important knowledge gaps and priority research needs in the science of biotic homogenization. Future studies should examine the homogenization process for different community properties (species occurrence and abundance) at multiple spatial and temporal scales, with careful attention paid to the various biological mechanisms (invasions vs. extinctions) and environmental drivers (environmental alteration vs. biotic interactions) involved. Perhaps most importantly, this research should recognize that there are multiple possible outcomes resulting from the accumulation of species invasions and extinctions, including biotic differentiation whereby genetic, taxonomic or functional similarity of biotas decreases over time.},

abstract = {Climate change over the past approximately 30 years has produced numerous shifts in the distributions and abundances of species and has been implicated in one species-level extinction. Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20{\%} of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37{\%} of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction ( approximately 18{\%}) than mid-range ( approximately 24{\%}) and maximum-change ( approximately 35{\%}) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {Previous work on the estimation of the invasiveness of insect pest species used a single Kohonen self-organising map (SOM) to quantify the invasion potential of each member of a set of species in relation to a particular geographic region. In this paper that method is critically compared to an alternative approach of calculating the invasive potential of insect pest species as an outcome of clustering of regional species assemblages. Data clustering was performed using SOM and k-means optimisation clustering and multiple trials were performed with each algorithm. The outcomes of these two approaches were evaluated and compared to the previously published results obtained from a single SOM. The results show firstly, due to the inherent variation between trials of the algorithms used, that multiple trials are necessary to determine reliable risk ratings, and secondly, that k-means clustering can be considered a more appropriate algorithm for this particular application, as it produces clusters of higher quality, as determined by objective cluster measures, and is far more computationally efficient than SOM. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the massive human and financial toll of invasive insects, cost estimates of their impacts remain sporadic, spatially incomplete and of questionable quality. We compiled the most comprehensive database of economic costs of invasive insects, expressing historical estimates in annual 2014-equivalent US dollars. Taking all reported goods and services estimates, invasive insects cost a minimum of US{\$}70.0 billion year-1 globally, while global health costs directly attributable to invasive insects exceed US{\$}6.9 billion year-1. Total costs rise as the number of estimates increases, although many of the worst costs have already been estimated (especially those related to human health). A lack of dedicated studies, especially for reproducible goods and services estimates, implies gross underestimation of global costs. Global warming as a consequence of climate change, rising human population densities and intensifying international trade will allow the costliest insects to spread into new areas, although substantial savings could be achieved by increasing surveillance, containment and public awareness.},

abstract = {A process-based niche model of L. camara L. (lantana), a highly invasive shrub species, was developed to estimate its potential distribution using CLIMEX. Model development was carried out using its native and invasive distribution and validation was carried out with the extensive Australian distribution. A good fit was observed, with 86.7{\%} of herbarium specimens collected in Australia occurring within the suitable and highly suitable categories. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the model parameters that had the most influence on lantana distribution. The changes in suitability were assessed by mapping the regions where the distribution changed with each parameter alteration. This allowed an assessment of where, within Australia, the modification of each parameter was having the most impact, particularly in terms of the suitable and highly suitable locations. The sensitivity of various parameters was also evaluated by calculating the changes in area within the suitable and highly suitable categories. The limiting low temperature (DV0), limiting high temperature (DV3) and limiting low soil moisture (SM0) showed highest sensitivity to change. The other model parameters were relatively insensitive to change. Highly sensitive parameters require extensive research and data collection to be fitted accurately in species distribution models. The results from this study can inform more cost effective development of species distribution models for lantana. Such models form an integral part of the management of invasive species and the results can be used to streamline data collection requirements for potential distribution modelling.},

These comprise a measure of the state of the problem (the number of IAS per country), a measure of the pressures IAS place on biodiversity (the Red List Index of impacts of IAS), and two measures of responses to the problem (trends in the number of international agreements relevant to reducing threats to biodiversity from IAS, and trends in the adoption of national legislation relevant to the control of IAS). {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {In one classification of models [16] the simulation to be described would be considered a demographic model whose primary objectives are instructional.' The model developed here may be used for forecasting, but was not constructed for this specific purpose, and it is a demographic model since it describes only population growth, with particular emphasis on the geographical distribu-tion of this growth. As a premise, I make the assumption that everything is related to everything else. Superficially considered this would suggest a model of infinite complexity; a corollary inference often made is that social systems are difficult because they contain many variables; numerous people confuse the number of variables with the degree of complexity. Because of clo-sure, however, models with infinite numbers of variables are in fact some-times more tractable than models with a finite but large number of variables [27]. My point here is that the utmost effort must be exercised to avoid writing a complicated model. It is very difficult to write a simple model but this, after all, is one of the objectives. If one plots a graph with increasing complexity on the abscissa, and increasing effectiveness on the other axis, it is well known that science is only asymptotic to one hun-dred percent effectiveness. No scientist claims otherwise. But the rate at which this effectiveness is achieved is extremely important, ceterus paribus. In other words, the objective is high success with a simple model. Statistical procedures which order the eigenvalues are popular for just this reason. Because a process appears complicated is also no reason to assume that it is the result of com--For a review of urban models see Lee [21]. plicated rules, examples are: the game of chess, the motion of the planets before Copernicus; evolution before Darwin and the double helix, geology before Hutton, mechanics before Newton, geog-raphy before Christaller, and so on [5]. The plausibility of models also varies, but this is known to be an incomplete guide to the scientific usefulness of a model. The model I describe, for exam-ple, recognizes that people die, are born, and migrate. It does not explain why people die, are born, and migrate. Some would insist that I should incorporate more behavioral notions, but then it would be necessary to discuss the psy-chology of urban growth; to do this properly requires a treatise on the bio-chemistry of perception, which in turn requires discussion of the physics of ion interchange, and so on. My attitude, rather, is that since I have not explained birth, death, or migration, the model might apply to any phenomenon which has these characteristics, e.g., people, plants, animals, machines (which are built, moved, and destroyed), or ideas. The level of generality seems inversely related to the specificity of the model. A model of urban growth should apply to all 92,290 cities [9, p. 81] (not just to one city), now and in the future, and to other things that grow. These are rather ambitious aims. Conversely, the model attempts to relate population totals only on the basis of prior popula-tions, and neglects employment oppor-tunities, topography, transportation, and other distinctions between site qualities. Consequently the only difference be-tween places in the model is their popu-lation density, and other demographic differences are ignored. Similarly, the population model attempts to relate},

abstract = {The notion of being sure that you have completely eradicated an invasive species is fanciful because of imperfect detection and persistent seed banks. Eradication is commonly declared either on an ad hoc basis, on notions of seed bank longevity, or on setting arbitrary thresholds of 1{\%} or 5{\%} confidence that the species is not present. Rather than declaring eradication at some arbitrary level of confidence, we take an economic approach in which we stop looking when the expected costs outweigh the expected benefits. We develop theory that determines the number of years of absent surveys required to minimize the net expected cost. Given detection of a species is imperfect, the optimal stopping time is a trade-off between the cost of continued surveying and the cost of escape and damage if eradication is declared too soon. A simple rule of thumb compares well to the exact optimal solution using stochastic dynamic programming. Application of the approach to the eradication programme of Helenium amarum reveals that the actual stopping time was a precautionary one given the ranges for each parameter.},

abstract = {Climate and weather can substantially influence the development and distribution of insects. Anthropogenically induced climatic change arising from increasing levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases would, therefore, be likely to have a significant effect on agricultural insect pests. Current best estimates of changes in climate indicate an increase in global mean annual temperatures of 1°C by 2025 and 3°C by the end of the next century. Such increases in temperature have a number of implications for temperature-dependent insect pests in mid-latitude regions. Changes in climate may result in changes in geographical distribution, increased overwintering, changes in population growth rates, increases in the number of generations, extension of the development season, changes in crop-pest synchrony, changes in interspecific interactions and increased risk of invasion by migrant pests. To illustrate some of these effects, results of a study investigating the impact of climatic change on the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) in Europe are shown. Under the climatic changes projected by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies general circulation model, northward shifts in the potential distribution of the European corn borer of up to 1220 km are estimated to occur, with an additional generation found in nearly all regions where it is currently known to occur. A number of priorities for future research into the effects of climatic changes on agricultural insect pests can be identified. These include: examination of the influence of climatic variables on insect pests, long-term monitoring of pest population levels and insect behaviour, consideration of possible climatic changes in research into pest management systems and identification of potential migrants. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

@article{Kraft2014,
abstract = {One of the most pervasive concepts in the study of community assembly is the metaphor of the environmental filter, which refers to abiotic factors that prevent the establishment or persistence of species in a particular location. The metaphor has its origins in the study of community change during succession and in plant community dynamics, although it has gained considerable attention recently as part of a surge of interest in functional trait and phylogenetic-based approaches to the study of communities. While the filtering metaphor has clear utility in some circumstances, it has been challenging to reconcile the environmental filtering concept with recent developments in ecological theory related to species coexistence. These advances suggest that the evidence used in many studies to assess environmental filtering is insufficient to distinguish filtering from the outcome of biotic interactions. We re-examine the environmental filtering metaphor from the perspective of coexistence theory. In an effort to move the discussion forward, we present a simple framework for considering the role of the environment in shaping community membership, review the literature to document the evidence typically used in environmental filtering studies and highlight research challenges to address in coming years. The current usage of the environmental filtering term in empirical studies likely overstates the role abiotic tolerances play in shaping community structure. We recommend that the term ‘environmental filtering' only be used to refer to cases where the abiotic environment prevents establishment or persistence in the absence of biotic interactions, although only 15{\%} of the studies in our review presented such evidence. Finally, we urge community ecologists to consider additional mechanisms aside from environmental filtering by which the abiotic environment can shape community pattern.},

abstract = {Changing land use and the spread of 'winning' native or exotic plants are expected to lead to biotic homogenization (BH), in which previously distinct plant communities become progressively more similar. In parallel, many ecosystems have recently seen increases in local species (alpha-) diversity, yet gamma-diversity has continued to decline at larger scales. Using national ecological surveillance data for Great Britain, we quantify relationships between change in alpha-diversity and between-habitat homogenizations at two levels of organization: species composition and plant functional traits. Across Britain both increases and decreases in alpha-diversity were observed in small random sampling plots (10-200m2) located within a national random sample of 1km square regions. As alpha-diversity declined (spatially in 1978 or temporally between 1978 and 1998), plant communities became functionally more similar, but species-compositional similarity declined. Thus, different communities converged on a narrower range of winning trait syndromes, but species identities remained historically contingent, differentiating a mosaic of residual species-poor habitat patches within each 1km square. The reverse trends in beta-diversity occurred where alpha-diversity increased. When impacted by the same type and intensity of environmental change, directions of change in alpha-diversity are likely to depend upon differences in starting productivity and disturbance. This is one reason why local diversity change and BH across habitats are not likely to be consistently coupled.},

abstract = {The relative operating characteristic (ROC) is a widely-used method to measure diagnostic signals including predictions of land changes, species distributions, and ecological niches. The ROC measures the degree to which presence for a Boolean variable is associated with high ranks of an index. The ROC curve plots the rate of true positives versus the rate of false positives obtained from the comparison between the Boolean variable and multiple diagnoses derived from thresholds applied to the index. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a summary metric, which is commonly reported and frequently criticized. Our manuscript recommends four improvements in the use and interpretation of the ROC curve and its AUC by: (1) highlighting important threshold points on the ROC curve, (2) interpreting the shape of the ROC curve, (3) defining lower and upper bounds for the AUC, and (4) mapping the density of the presence within each bin of the ROC curve. These recommendations encourage scientists to interpret the rich information that the ROC curve can reveal, in a manner that goes far beyond the potentially misleading AUC. We illustrate the benefit of our recommendations by assessing the prediction of land change in a suburban landscape. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Information on non-native species (NNS) is often scattered among a multitude of sources, such as regional and national databases, peer-reviewed and grey literature, unpublished research projects, institutional datasets and with taxonomic experts. Here we report on the development of a database designed for the collation of information in Britain. The project involved working with volunteer experts to populate a database of NNS (hereafter called “the species register”). Each species occupies a row within the database with information on aspects of the species' biology such as environment (marine, freshwater, terrestrial etc.), functional type (predator, parasite etc.), habitats occupied in the invaded range (using EUNIS classification), invasion pathways, establishment status in Britain and impacts. The information is delivered through the Great Britain Non-Native Species Information Portal hosted by the Non-Native Species Secretariat. By the end of 2011 there were 1958 established NNS in Britain. There has been a dramatic increase over time in the rate of NNS arriving in Britain and those becoming established. The majority of established NNS are higher plants (1,376 species). Insects are the next most numerous group (344 species) followed by non-insect invertebrates (158 species), vertebrates (50 species), algae (24 species) and lower plants (6 species). Inventories of NNS are seen as an essential tool in the management of biological invasions. The use of such lists is diverse and far-reaching. However, the increasing number of new arrivals highlights both the dynamic nature of invasions and the importance of updating NNS inventories.},

abstract = {Motivated by questions such as "Why do some diseases take off, while others die out?" and "How can we optimize the deployment of control methods," we introduce simple epidemiological concepts for the invasion and persistence of plant pathogens. An overarching modeling framework is then presented that can be used to analyze disease invasion and persistence at a range of scales from the microscopic to the regional. Criteria for invasion and persistence are introduced, initially for simple models of epidemics, and then for models with greater biological realism. Some ways in which epidemiological models are used to identify optimal strategies for the control of disease are discussed. Particular attention is given to the spatial structure of host populations and to the role of chance events in determining invasion and persistence of plant pathogens. Finally, three brief case studies are used to illustrate the practical applications of epidemiological theory to understand invasion and persistence of plant pathogens. These comprise long-term predictions for the persistence and control of Dutch elm disease; identification of methods to manage the spread of rhizomania on sugar beet in the U.K. by matching the scale of control with the spatial and temporal scales of the disease; and analysis of evolutionary change in virus control to identify risks of inadvertent selection for damaging virus strains.},

While the problem is global, the nature and severity of the impacts on society, economic life, health, and natural heritage are distributed unevenly across nations and regions. Thus, some aspects of the problem require solutions tailored to the specific values, needs, and priorities of nations while others call for consolidated action by the larger world community. Preventing the international movement of invasive alien species and coordinating a timely and effective response to invasions will require cooperation and collaboration among governments, economic sectors, non-governmental organisations, and international treaty organisations. This strategy highlights the dimensions of the problem and outlines a framework for mounting a global-scale response. While both the problem and the scale of the solution may appear dauntingly complex, the issue presents an unparalleled opportunity to respond with actions that link preservation of biodiversity with protection of the health and livelihood of the world's human populations.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. Although invasive alien species (IAS) are a major threat to biodiversity, human health, and economy, our understanding of the factors controlling their distribution and abundance is limited. Here, we determine how environmental factors, land use, life-history traits of the invaders, residence time, origin, and human usage interact to shape the spatial pattern of invasive alien plant species in South Africa. Relationships between the environ mental factors and the extrinsic and intrinsic attributes of species were investigated using RLQ analysis, a multivariate method for relating a species-attribute table to an environmental table by way of a species presence/absence table. We then clustered species according to their position on the RLQ axes, and tested these groups for phylogenetic independence. The first three axes of the RLQ explained 99{\%} of the variation and were strongly related to the species attributes. The clustering showed that, after accounting for environmental factors, the spatial pattern of IAS in South Africa was driven by human uses, life forms, and reproductive traits. The seven clusters of species strongly reflected geographical distribution, but also intrinsic species attributes and patterns of human use. Two of the clusters, centered on the genera Acacia and Opuntia, were phylogenetically non-independent. The remaining clusters comprised species of diverse taxonomic affinities, but sharing traits facilitating invasion in particular habitats. This information is useful for assessing the extent to which the potential spread of recent introductions can be predicted by considering the interaction of their biological attributes, region of origin, and human use.},

abstract = {The ecological literature reveals considerable confusion about the meaning of validation in the context of simulation models. The confusion arises as much from semantic and philosophical considerations as from the selection of validation procedures. Validation is not a procedure for testing scientific theory or for certifying the 'truth' of current scientific understanding, nor is it a required activity of every modelling project. Validation means that a model is acceptable for its intended use because it meets specified performance requirements. Before validation is undertaken, (1) the purpose of the model, (2) the performance criteria, and (3) the model context must be specified. The validation process can be decomposed into several components: (1) operation, (2) theory, and (3) data. Important concepts needed to understand the model evaluation process are verification, calibration, validation, credibility, and qualification. These terms are defined in a limited technical sense applicable to the evaluation of simulation models, and not as general philosophical concepts. Different tests and standards are applied to the operational, theoretical, and data components. The operational and data components can be validated; the theoretical component cannot. The most common problem with ecological and environmental models is failure to state what the validation criteria are. Criteria must be explicitly stated because there are no universal standards for selecting what test procedures or criteria to use for validation. A test based on comparison of simulated versus observed data is generally included whenever possible. Because the objective and subjective components of validation are not mutually exclusive, disagreements over the meaning of validation can only be resolved by establishing a convention.},

The behaviour of both Marriott's criterion and the new criterion is investigated by Monte Carlo methods. For homogeneous data based on uniform and independent variables, the performance of the new criterion is close to expectation while Marriott's criterion shows much more extreme behaviour. For grouped data, the new criterion correctly identifies the number of groups in 85{\%} of data sets under a wide range of conditions, while Marriott's criterion shows a success rate of less than 40{\%}. The new criterion is illustrated on the well- known Iris data, and some cautionary comments are made about its use.},

However, alien species differ dramatically in the size of their invasive ranges. Here we present the first study to quantify the level of invasion for several regions of the world in terms of the most widely distributed plant species (natives vs. aliens). Aliens accounted for 51.3{\%} of the 120 most widely distributed plant species in North America, 43.3{\%} in New South Wales (Australia), 34.2{\%} in Chile, 29.7{\%} in Argentina, and 22.5{\%} in the Republic of South Africa. However, Europe had only 1{\%} of alien species among the most widespread species of the flora. Across regions, alien species relative to native species were either as well-distributed (10 comparisons) or more widely distributed (5 comparisons). These striking patterns highlight the profound contribution that widespread invasive alien plants make to floristic dominance patterns across different regions. Many of the most widespread species are alien plants, and, in particular, Europe and Asia appear as major contributors to the homogenization of the floras in the Americas. We recommend that spatial extent of invasion should be explicitly incorporated in assessments of invasibility, globalization, and risk assessments.},

abstract = {We contend that the main source of uncertainty in model predictions is often related to uncertainties in the conceptual model. While different approaches have been proposed for designing experiments so as to reduce the uncertainty of estimated parameters, much less attention has been devoted to the problem of experiment design for conceptual model discrimination. We propose a criterion for ensuring that a given design will indeed lead to data with sufficient discriminating capacity. This is based on finding, via automatic calibration algorithms, the minimum distance between simulations of the experiment obtained with the alternative models. If the distances thus obtained for all model pairings are large enough, then the proposed experiment can be used for effectively selecting one among those models (provided that 'reality' is closely reproduced by one of them). This methodology is applied to a uranium tracer test performed on unaltered granite samples at the Paul Scherrer Institute and which was part of INTRAVAL test case 1b. Using half of the data for calibrating three conceptual models shows that two of them cannot be rejected as valid representations of reality. We use the second half of data to demonstrate that they do not provide sufficient model discrimination capacity, despite the fact that existing criteria would suggest the opposite. We then proceed to propose an additional experiment for resolving the indetermination. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Invasive species present significant threats to global agriculture, although how the magnitude and distribution of the threats vary between countries and regions remains unclear. Here, we present an analysis of almost 1,300 known invasive insect pests and pathogens, calculating the total potential cost of these species invading each of 124 countries of the world, as well as determining which countries present the greatest threat to the rest of the world given their trading partners and incumbent pool of invasive species. We find that countries vary in terms of potential threat from invasive species and also their role as potential sources, with apparently similar countries sometimes varying markedly depending on specifics of agricultural commodities and trade patterns. Overall, the biggest agricultural producers (China and the United States) could experience the greatest absolute cost from further species invasions. However, developing countries, in particular, Sub-Saharan African countries, appear most vulnerable in relative terms. Furthermore, China and the United States represent the greatest potential sources of invasive species for the rest of the world. The analysis reveals considerable scope for ongoing redistribution of known invasive pests and highlights the need for international cooperation to slow their spread.},

To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environ- $\backslash$nmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another application allows the use of species data in other methods of multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function; an example is K-means partitioning.},

We examine a number of techniques, based on summary statistics and graphics derived from the trained SOM, and conclude that they work well in cooperation with each other. Useful tools include the median interneuron distance matrix and the projection of the trained map (via Sammon's mapping). SOM quantization errors provide an important complementary source of information for certain type of outlying behavior. Empirical results are reported on both artificial and real data.},

One of the most important issues in the correct use of k-means is the initialization procedure that ultimately determines which part of the solution space will be searched. In this paper we briefly review different initialization procedures, and propose Kohonens Self- Organizing Maps as the most convenient method, given the proper training parameters. Furthermore, we show that in the final stages of its training procedure the Self-Organizing Map algorithms is rigorously the same as the kmeans algorithm. Thus we propose the use of Self-Organizing Maps as possible substitutes for the more classical k-means clustering algorithms.},

However, it has recently been shown that the measure is fundamentally incoherent, in the sense that it treats the relative severities of misclassifications differently when different classifiers are used. The H measure overcomes this by allowing a researcher to fix the distribution of relative severities to a classifier-independent setting on a given problem. This note extends the discussion, and proposes a modified standard distribution for the H measure, which better matches the requirements of researchers, the Beta(??1+1,??0+1) distribution. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Biological invasions are increasing and are strongly associated with negative agricultural, economic and ecological impacts. It is increasingly recognized that the primary focus in minimizing biological invasions should be to prevent initial entry of alien species. However, exclusion of terrestrial arthropods such as insects and mites is difficult, in part because of their relatively small size, cryptic habits, broad physiological tolerances and close association with various internationally traded goods. Here we discuss methods, approaches, management and intervention systems used by border biosecurity agencies to prevent entry of inadvertently transported arthropods. We examine the at-border systems that exist for the detection and identification of and response to alien arthropods, and discuss the constraints and challenges present in these systems. We critically review current border biosecurity systems and discuss their relative efficacy. We then discuss additional measures and key areas that could be addressed that may further improve these systems. These include: (1) the application of appropriate sampling strategies; (2) employment of suitable inspection methods adequate to detect small and hidden arthropods; and (3) thorough recording of methods, organisms detected and both negative and positive results of inspections. We emphasize that more research is needed on taxonomy, biology, genetics, distribution, host and disease associations, impacts and pathways of introductions for invasive arthropods. Of critical importance is the compilation of complete and accurate invasive species lists and high-risk species watch-lists. The adoption of these recommendations will contribute to improved biosecurity systems for the exclusion of alien, invasive and pest arthropods.},

abstract = {Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was first published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difficulty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A terminology and typology of uncertainty is presented together with a framework for the modelling process, its interaction with the broader water management process and the role of uncertainty at different stages in the modelling processes. Brief reviews have been made of 14 different (partly complementary) methods commonly used in uncertainty assessment and characterisation: data uncertainty engine (DUE), error propagation equations, expert elicitation, extended peer review, inverse modelling (parameter estimation), inverse modelling (predictive uncertainty), Monte Carlo analysis, multiple model simulation, NUSAP, quality assurance, scenario analysis, sensitivity analysis, stakeholder involvement and uncertainty matrix. The applicability of these methods has been mapped according to purpose of application, stage of the modelling process and source and type of uncertainty addressed. It is concluded that uncertainty assessment is not just something to be added after the completion of the modelling work. Instead uncertainty should be seen as a red thread throughout the modelling study starting from the very beginning, where the identification and characterisation of all uncertainty sources should be performed jointly by the modeller, the water manager and the stakeholders. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {There is little consensus about how natural (e.g. productivity, disturbance) and anthropogenic (e.g. invasive species, habitat destruction) ecological drivers influence biodiversity. Here, we show that when sampling is standardised by area (species density) or individuals (rarefied species richness), the measured effect sizes depend critically on the spatial grain and extent of sampling, as well as the size of the species pool. This compromises comparisons of effects sizes within studies using standard statistics, as well as among studies using meta-analysis. To derive an unambiguous effect size, we advocate that comparisons need to be made on a scale-independent metric, such as Hurlbert's Probability of Interspecific Encounter. Analyses of this metric can be used to disentangle the relative influence of changes in the absolute and relative abundances of individuals, as well as their intraspecific aggregations, in driving differences in biodiversity among communities. This and related approaches are necessary to achieve generality in understanding how biodiversity responds to ecological drivers and will necessitate a change in the way many ecologists collect and analyse their data.},

abstract = {The power model, S = cA(z) ( where S is number of species, A is area,
and c and z are fitted constants), is the model most commonly fitted to
species-area data assessing species diversity. We use the
self-similarity properties of this model to reveal patterns implicated
by the z parameter. We present the basic arithmetic leading both to the
fraction of new species added when two areas are combined and to species
overlap between two areas of the same size, given a continuous sampling
scheme. The fraction of new species resulting from expansion of an area
can be expressed as a alpha(z) - 1, where alpha is the expansion factor.
Consequently, z-values can be converted to a scale-invariant species
overlap between two equally sized areas, since the proportion of species
in common between the two areas is 2 - 2(z). Calculating overlap when
adding areas of the same size reveals the intrinsic effect of distance
assumed by the bisectional scheme. We use overlap - area relationships
from empirical data sets to illustrate how answers to the single large
or several small reserves (SLOSS) question vary between data sets and
with scale. We conclude that species overlap and the effect of distance
between sample areas or isolates should be addressed when discussing
species - area relationships, and lack of fit to the power model can be
caused by its assumption of a scale-invariant overlap relationship.},

abstract = {Predicting the distribution of endangered species from habitat data is frequently perceived to be a useful technique. Models that predict the presence or absence of a species are normally judged by the number of pre- diction errors. These may be of two types: false posi- tives and false negatives. Many of the prediction errors can be traced to ecological processes such as unsatu- rated habitat and species interactions. Consequently, if prediction errors are not placed in an ecological con- text the results of the model may be misleading. The simplest, and most widely used, measure of prediction accuracy is the number of correctly classified cases. There are other measures of prediction success that may be more appropriate. Strategies for assessing the causes and costs of these errors are discussed. A range of techniques for measuring error in presence/absence models, including some that are seldom used by ecol- ogists (e.g. ROC plots and cost matrices), are de- scribed. A new approach to estimating prediction error, which is based on the spatial characteristics of the errors, is proposed. Thirteen recommendations are made to enable the objective selection of an error assessment technique for ecological presence/absence models.},

While the problem is global, the nature and severity of the impacts on society, economic life, health, and natural heritage are distributed unevenly across nations and regions. Thus, some aspects of the problem require solutions tailored to the specific values, needs, and priorities of nations while others call for consolidated action by the larger world community. Preventing the international movement of invasive alien species and coordinating a timely and effective response to invasions will require cooperation and collaboration among governments, economic sectors, non-governmental organisations, and international treaty organisations. This strategy highlights the dimensions of the problem and outlines a framework for mounting a global-scale response. While both the problem and the scale of the solution may appear dauntingly complex, the issue presents an unparalleled opportunity to respond with actions that link preservation of biodiversity with protection of the health and livelihood of the world's human populations.},

We therefore lack a thorough understanding of the global patterns of alien species spread. Using native and alien ranges of 1380 alien species, we show that the number of alien species follows a hump-shaped function of geographic distance. We observe distinct variations in the relationship between alien species exchanges and distance among taxonomic groups, which relate to the taxa-specific dispersal modes and their pathways of introduction. We formulate a simple statistical model, combining trade volume and biogeographic dissimilarity, which reproduces the observed pattern in good agreement with reported data and even captures variations among taxonomic groups. This study demonstrates the universality of the intermediate distance hypothesis of alien species spread across taxonomic groups, which will help to improve the predictability of new alien species arrivals.

abstract = {Aim The aims of this study are to resolve terminological confusion around different types of species–area relationships (SARs) and their delimitation from species sampling relationships (SSRs), to provide a comprehensive overview of models and analytical methods for SARs, to evaluate these theoretically and empirically, and to suggest a more consistent approach for the treatment of species–area data.Location Curonian Spit in north-west Russia and archipelagos world-wide.Methods First, I review various typologies for SARs and SSRs as well as mathematical models, fitting procedures and goodness-of-fit measures applied to SARs. This results in a list of 23 function types, which are applicable both for untransformed (S) and for log-transformed (log S) species richness. Then, example data sets for nested plots in continuous vegetation (n = 14) and islands (n = 6) are fitted to a selection of 12 function types (linear, power, logarithmic, saturation, sigmoid) both for S and for log S. The suitability of these models is assessed with Akaike's information criterion for S and log S, and with a newly proposed metric that addresses extrapolation capability.Results SARs, which provide species numbers for different areas and have no upper asymptote, must be distinguished from SSRs, which approach the species richness of one single area asymptotically. Among SARs, nested plots in continuous ecosystems, non-nested plots in continuous ecosystems, and isolates can be distinguished. For the SARs of the empirical data sets, the normal and quadratic power functions as well as two of the sigmoid functions (Lomolino, cumulative beta-P) generally performed well. The normal power function (fitted for S) was particularly suitable for predicting richness values over ten-fold increases in area. Linear, logarithmic, convex saturation and logistic functions generally were inappropriate. However, the two sigmoid models produced unstable results with arbitrary parameter estimates, and the quadratic power function resulted in decreasing richness values for large areas.Main conclusions Based on theoretical considerations and empirical results, I suggest that the power law should be used to describe and compare any type of SAR while at the same time testing whether the exponent z changes with spatial scale. In addition, one should be aware that power-law parameters are significantly influenced by methodology.},

abstract = {Alien species are a major component of human-induced environmental change. Variation in the numbers of alien species found in different areas is likely to depend on a combination of anthropogenic and environmental factors, with anthropogenic factors affecting the number of species introduced to new locations, and when, and environmental factors influencing how many species are able to persist there. However, global spatial and temporal variation in the drivers of alien introduction and species richness remain poorly understood. Here, we analyse an extensive new database of alien birds to explore what determines the global dis- tribution of alien species richness for an entire taxonomic class. We demonstrate that the locations of origin and introduction of alien birds, and their identities, were initially driven largely by European (mainly British) colonialism. However, recent introduction s are a wider phenomenon, involving more species and countries, and driven in part by increasing eco- nomic activity. We find that, globally, alien bird species richness is currently highest at mid- latitudes and is strongly determined by anthropogenic effects, most notably the number of species introduced (i.e., ™colonisation pressure∫). Nevertheless, environmental drivers are also important, with native and alien species richness being strongly and consistently posi- tively associated. Our results demonstrate that colonisation pressure is key to understand- ing alien species richness, show that areas of high native species richness are not resistant to colonisation by alien species at the global scale, and emphasise the likely ongoing threats to global environments from introductions of species.},

abstract = {Alien species can change the recipient environment in various ways, and some of them cause considerable damage. Understanding such impacts is crucial to direct management actions. This study addresses the following questions: Is it possible to quantify impact across higher taxa in a comparative manner? Do impacts differ between taxonomic groups? How are environmental and socio-economic impacts related? Can impacts be predicted based on those in other regions? To address these questions, we reviewed literature describing the impacts of 300 species from five major taxonomic groups: mammals, birds, fish, terrestrial arthropods and plants. To make very diverse impact measures comparable, we used the semi-quantitative generic impact scoring system (GISS) which describes environmental and socio-economic impacts using twelve categories. In each category, scores range from zero (no impact known or detectable) to five (the highest possible impact). Using the same scoring system for taxa as diverse as invertebrates, vertebrates and plants, we found that overall, alien mammals in Europe have the highest impact, while fish have the lowest. Terrestrial arthropods were found to have the lowest environmental impact, while fish had relatively low socio-economic impact. Overall, the magnitude of environmental and socio-economic impacts of individual alien species is highly correlated. However, at the species level, major deviations are found. For mammals and birds, the impacts in invaded ranges outside of Europe are broadly similar to those recorded for alien species within Europe, indicating that a consideration of the known impacts of a species in other regions can be generally useful when predicting the impacts of an alien species. However, it should be noted that this pattern is not consistent across all mammal and bird orders, and thus, such information should be considered with caution. Synthesis and applications. Comparing the impacts of alien species across taxa is necessary for prioritizing management efforts and effective allocation of resources. By applying the generic impact scoring system (GISS) to five major taxonomic groups, we provide the basis for a semi-quantitative cross-taxa listing process (e.g. ‘black lists' or 100-worst-lists). If more data are collated from different geographical regions and habitats using standard GISS protocols, risk assessments for alien species based on rigorous measures of impact could be improved by taking into account local variation, and context dependence of impacts. This would also allow studies at lower taxonomic levels, and within-taxon analyses of functional groups and guilds.},

abstract = {In one classification of models [16] the simulation to be described would be considered a demographic model whose primary objectives are instructional.' The model developed here may be used for forecasting, but was not constructed for this specific purpose, and it is a demographic model since it describes only population growth, with particular emphasis on the geographical distribu-tion of this growth. As a premise, I make the assumption that everything is related to everything else. Superficially considered this would suggest a model of infinite complexity; a corollary inference often made is that social systems are difficult because they contain many variables; numerous people confuse the number of variables with the degree of complexity. Because of clo-sure, however, models with infinite numbers of variables are in fact some-times more tractable than models with a finite but large number of variables [27]. My point here is that the utmost effort must be exercised to avoid writing a complicated model. It is very difficult to write a simple model but this, after all, is one of the objectives. If one plots a graph with increasing complexity on the abscissa, and increasing effectiveness on the other axis, it is well known that science is only asymptotic to one hun-dred percent effectiveness. No scientist claims otherwise. But the rate at which this effectiveness is achieved is extremely important, ceterus paribus. In other words, the objective is high success with a simple model. Statistical procedures which order the eigenvalues are popular for just this reason. Because a process appears complicated is also no reason to assume that it is the result of com--For a review of urban models see Lee [21]. plicated rules, examples are: the game of chess, the motion of the planets before Copernicus; evolution before Darwin and the double helix, geology before Hutton, mechanics before Newton, geog-raphy before Christaller, and so on [5]. The plausibility of models also varies, but this is known to be an incomplete guide to the scientific usefulness of a model. The model I describe, for exam-ple, recognizes that people die, are born, and migrate. It does not explain why people die, are born, and migrate. Some would insist that I should incorporate more behavioral notions, but then it would be necessary to discuss the psy-chology of urban growth; to do this properly requires a treatise on the bio-chemistry of perception, which in turn requires discussion of the physics of ion interchange, and so on. My attitude, rather, is that since I have not explained birth, death, or migration, the model might apply to any phenomenon which has these characteristics, e.g., people, plants, animals, machines (which are built, moved, and destroyed), or ideas. The level of generality seems inversely related to the specificity of the model. A model of urban growth should apply to all 92,290 cities [9, p. 81] (not just to one city), now and in the future, and to other things that grow. These are rather ambitious aims. Conversely, the model attempts to relate population totals only on the basis of prior popula-tions, and neglects employment oppor-tunities, topography, transportation, and other distinctions between site qualities. Consequently the only difference be-tween places in the model is their popu-lation density, and other demographic differences are ignored. Similarly, the population model attempts to relate},

abstract = {Climate change has already triggered species distribution shifts in many parts of the world. Increasing impacts are expected for the future, yet few studies have aimed for a general understanding of the regional basis for species vulnerability. We projected late 21st century distributions for 1,350 European plants species under seven climate change scenarios. Application of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List criteria to our projections shows that many European plant species could become severely threatened. More than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080. Expected species loss and turnover per pixel proved to be highly variable across scenarios (27-42{\%} and 45-63{\%} respectively, averaged over Europe) and across regions (2.5-86{\%} and 17-86{\%}, averaged over scenarios). Modeled species loss and turnover were found to depend strongly on the degree of change in just two climate variables describing temperature and moisture conditions. Despite the coarse scale of the analysis, species from mountains could be seen to be disproportionably sensitive to climate change (approximately 60{\%} species loss). The boreal region was projected to lose few species, although gaining many others from immigration. The greatest changes are expected in the transition between the Mediterranean and Euro-Siberian regions. We found that risks of extinction for European plants may be large, even in moderate scenarios of climate change and despite inter-model variability.},

It avoids the supposed subjectivity in the threshold selection process, when continuous probability derived scores are converted to a binary presence–absence variable, by summarizing overall model performance over all possible thresholds. In this manuscript we review some of the features of this measure and bring into question its reliability as a comparative measure of accuracy between model results. We do not recommend using AUC for five reasons: (1) it ignores the predicted probability values and the goodness-of-fit of the model; (2) it summarises the test performance over regions of the ROC space in which one would rarely operate; (3) it weights omission and commission errors equally; (4) it does not give information about the spatial distribution of model errors; and, most importantly, (5) the total extent to which models are carried out highly influences the rate of well-predicted absences and the AUC scores.},

abstract = {Crop pests and pathogens pose a significant and growing threat to food security, but their geographical distributions are poorly understood. We present a global analysis of pest and pathogen distributions, to determine the roles of socioeconomic and biophysical factors in determining pest diversity, controlling for variation in observational capacity among countries. Known distributions of 1901 pests and pathogens were obtained from CABI. Linear models were used to partition the variation in pest species per country amongst predictors. Reported pest numbers increased with per capita gross domestic product (GDP), research expenditure and research capacity, and the influence of economics was greater in micro-organisms than in arthropods. Total crop production and crop diversity were the strongest physical predictors of pest numbers per country, but trade and tourism were insignificant once other factors were controlled. Islands reported more pests than mainland countries, but no latitudinal gradient in species richness was evident. Country wealth is likely to be a strong indicator of observational capacity, not just trade flow, as has been interpreted in invasive species studies. If every country had US levels of per capita GDP, then 205 ± 9 additional pests per country would be reported, suggesting that enhanced investment in pest observations will reveal the hidden threat of crop pests and pathogens.},

Because bioinvasions pose significant threats to marine ecosystems and the goods and services these provide, non-indigenous species (NIS) are included in the more recent legislative documents. A major challenge for the scientific community is to translate the principles of the legislative directives into a realistic, integrated ecosystem-based approach and at the same time provide stakeholders with best practices for managing NIS. The aim of this paper, prepared by members of the Working Group on Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms (WGITMO) of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), is to provide guidance for the application of NIS related management in the European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Ten recommendations, including NIS identification, standardization of sampling and data, indicators, propagule pressure and management issues are considered in this paper. While most of these suggestions were developed to improve the implementation of the MSFD, several may be more widely applicable. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The uncertainties involved in the tiered approach of an integrative assessment, however have not been quantified resulting in a risk of committing type I error or type II error at the final confirmatory stage. This study develops statistical criteria and guidelines for the sediment chemistry component of an integrative assessment of sediment quality. At the tier 1 screening stage, historical data or an initial survey is required to determine the minimum sample numbers that will be required to be representative of the study site. Understanding the guiding principles which have underpinned the setting of sediment quality criteria for contaminant is an important factor in tier 1 evaluations. To reduce cost and uncertainty in data, sampling should include the least number of samples necessary to minimise uncertainties by estimating the probability distribution function (which represents the variability of the natural environment at the location of concern), with subsequent application of kriging and sequential simulation methods on data obtained. Implementation of statistical criteria and guidelines in sediment quality assessments can provide a foundation for a further quantitative cost/benefit analysis and decrease the risk of committing type I and type II statistical errors at later classification stages.},

abstract = {1. There is a clear need to increase our ability to predict the consequences of environmental change. The seven main approaches that are currently used are: extrapolation, experiments, phenomenological models, game-theory population models, expert opinion, outcome-driven modelling and scenarios. Each approach has different strengths and weaknesses. In practice, several approaches are often combined. 2. Adaptive management aimed at testing hypotheses is excellent in principle and widely advocated. In reality, however, it is almost never carried out because the changes in management usually have to be severe in order to bring about detectable changes in a reasonable time, and the political risks of such management are usually considered too high. 3. Game-theory population models are used to determine population-level phenomena based upon the decisions individuals make in response to resource depletion, interference, territoriality or rank. This allows predictions to be made regarding responses to novel conditions. The main drawback is that for some models considerable information is required. 4. Much of conservation practice is not based upon evidence. Evidence-based conservation is the practice of accumulating, reviewing and disseminating evidence with the aim of formulating appropriate management strategies. Evidence-based medicine revolutionized medical practice and similar opportunities exist to improve conservation practice. 5. Synthesis and applications . The conventional approach of making assumptions and deriving models to make predictions about the consequences of environmental change is often unsatisfactory for complex problems, with considerable uncertainty. Tackling such problems is likely to require greater exploration of techniques such as expert opinion, output-driven modelling and scenarios.},

abstract = {The widespread replacement of native species with cosmopolitan, nonnative species is homogenizing the global fauna and flora. While the empirical study of biotic homogenization is substantial and growing, theoretical aspects have yet to be explored. Consequently, the breadth of possible ecological mechanisms that can shape current and future patterns and rates of homogenization remain largely unknown. Here, we develop a conceptual model that describes 14 potential scenarios by which species invasions and/or extinctions can lead to various trajectories of biotic homogenization (increased community similarity) or differentiation (decreased community similarity); we then use a simulation approach to explore the model's predictions. We found changes in community similarity to vary with the type and number of nonnative and native species, the historical degree of similarity among the communities, and, to a lesser degree, the richness of the recipient communities. Homogenization is greatest when similar species invade communities, causing either no extinction or differential extinction of native species. The model predictions are consistent with current empirical data for fish, bird, and plant communities and therefore may represent the dominant mechanisms of contemporary homogenization. We present a unifying model illustrating how the balance between invading and extinct species dictates the outcome of biotic homogenization. We conclude by discussing a number of critical but largely unrecognized issues that bear on the empirical study of biotic homogenization, including the importance of spatial scale, temporal scale, and data resolution. We argue that the study of biotic homogenization needs to be placed in a more mechanistic and predictive framework in order for studies to provide adequate guidance in conservation efforts to maintain regional distinctness of the global biota.},

abstract = {When evaluating the risks of future invasions, we often have sparse information on the likelihood that a species will arrive, establish and spread in a new environment, and on the potential impacts should this occur. Conventional risk assessment, therefore, is limited in providing guidance in managing the risk of non-indigenous species (NIS). However, risk management decisions must be made facing these uncertainties to avoid high and irreversible impacts.We develop an integrated ecological economic modeling and deliberative multi-criteria evaluation (DMCE) approach to support group decision-making in risk prioritization, using an example of ten NIS that could potentially impact Australian plant industries. This innovative approach seeks to combine the advantages of dynamic modeling with the benefits of DMCE in assessing and communicating uncertainty. The model unveils the complexity of the socio-ecological system of biological invasion, with a scenario analysis designed to interactively communicate scientific uncertainty to decision-makers. The DMCE provides a structured approach to identifying stakeholders' key concerns in addressing economic, social, and environmental dimensions of NIS risk explicitly. Functioning as a platform for risk communication, the DMCE also offers an opportunity for diverse views to enter the decision-making process and for the negotiation of consensus consensuses. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In this article we suggest that the reconstruction of invasion routes with population genetics-based methods can address fundamental questions in ecology and practical aspects of the management of biological invasions in agricultural settings. We provide a brief description of the methods used to reconstruct invasion routes and describe their main characteristics. In particular, we focus on a scenario - the bridgehead invasion scenario -, which had been overlooked until recently. We show that this scenario, in which an invasive population is the source of other invasive populations, is evolutionarily parsimonious and may have played a crucial role in shaping the distribution of many recent agricultural pests. ?? 2011 Acad??mie des sciences.},

@article{Lodge2006,
abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

abstract = {Global biodiversity is in decline. This is of concern for aesthetic and ethical reasons, but possibly also for practical reasons, as suggested by experimental studies, mostly with plants, showing that biodiversity reductions in small study plots can lead to compromised ecosystem function. However, inferring that ecosystem functions will decline due to biodiversity loss in the real world rests on the untested assumption that such loss is actually occurring at these small scales in nature. Using a global database of 168 published studies and {\textgreater}16,000 nonexperimental, local-scale vegetation plots, we show that mean temporal change in species diversity over periods of 5-261 y is not different from zero, with increases at least as likely as declines over time. Sites influenced primarily by plant species' invasions showed a tendency for declines in species richness, whereas sites undergoing postdisturbance succession showed increases in richness over time. Other distinctions among studies had little influence on temporal richness trends. Although maximizing diversity is likely important for maintaining ecosystem function in intensely managed systems such as restored grasslands or tree plantations, the clear lack of any general tendency for plant biodiversity to decline at small scales in nature directly contradicts the key assumption linking experimental results to ecosystem function as a motivation for biodiversity conservation in nature. How often real world changes in the diversity and composition of plant communities at the local scale cause ecosystem function to deteriorate, or actually to improve, remains unknown and is in critical need of further study.},

abstract = {Some alien species cause substantial impacts, yet most are innocuous. Given limited resources, forecasting risks from alien species will help prioritise management. Given that risk assessment (RA) approaches vary widely, a synthesis is timely to highlight best practices. We reviewed quantitative and scoring RAs, integrating {\textgreater} 300 publications into arguably the most rigorous quantitative RA framework currently existing, and mapping each study onto our framework, which combines Transport, Establishment, Abundance, Spread and Impact (TEASI). Quantitative models generally measured single risk components (78{\%} of studies), often focusing on Establishment alone (79{\%}). Although dominant in academia, quantitative RAs are underused in policy, and should be made more accessible. Accommodating heterogeneous limited data, combining across risk components, and developing generalised RAs across species, space and time without requiring new models for each species may increase attractiveness for policy applications. Comparatively, scoring approaches covered more risk components (50{\%} examined {\textgreater} 3 components), with Impact being the most common component (87{\%}), and have been widely applied in policy ({\textgreater} 57{\%}), but primarily employed expert opinion. Our framework provides guidance for questions asked, combining scores and other improvements. Our risk framework need not be completely parameterised to be informative, but instead identifies opportunities for improvement in alien species RA.},

We match this upper bound by two NP-completeness lower bounds, when the fixed query contains either negation or recursion and is applied to Codd-tables.

abstract = {Biological similartiy typically decreases with geographical distance. Despite the recent attention to the distance decay relationship, there is no consensus on how the relationship varies across organism groups, geographic gradients and environments. We first conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of 401 distance decay relationships across a wide range of organisms, ecosystems and geographical gradients, and then united the effects of categorical and continuous variables on the rate of distance decay using a general linear model (GLM). As effect sizes we used the similarity at one km distance (initial similarity) and the distance that halves the similarity from its value at one km distance (halving distance). Both the initial similarity and halving distance were significantly affected by variables characterizing the spatial scale, organism properties, study region and ecosystem concerned. The patterns appear robust as the results of meta-analysis and GLM only differed in marginal details. According to GLM with Akaike's information criterion, the most parsimonious models explained 55.3 and 37.6{\%} of variance in initial similarity and halving distance, respectively. Across large scales, similarity was decreasing slightly faster at high latitudes than at low latitudes, while small-scale turnover was higher at low latitudes. We also found significant differences in initial similarity among the realms, with terrestrial systems showing higher small-scale beta diversity. The decrease in community similarity at large scales was higher among organisms that are actively mobile than among passively dispersed organisms. We conclude that regression of similarity against distance unites several ecological phenomena such as dispersal propensity and environmental structuring, and provides an effective approach for gauging the spatial turnover across sites. We also found that the patterns in beta-diversity are highly scale-dependent.},

abstract = {Today, biodiversity decreases from equatorial to polar regions. This is a fundamental pattern governing the distribution of extant organisms, the understanding of which is critical to predicting climatically driven biodiversity loss. However, its causes remain unresolved. The fossil record offers a unique perspective on the evolution of this latitudinal biodiversity gradient (LBG), providing a dynamic system in which to explore spatiotemporal diversity fluctuations. Deep-time studies indicate that a tropical peak and poleward decline in species diversity has not been a persistent pattern throughout the Phanerozoic, but is restricted to intervals of the Palaeozoic and the past 30 million years. A tropical peak might characterise cold icehouse climatic regimes, whereas warmer greenhouse regimes display temperate diversity peaks or flattened gradients.},

abstract = {Although pairwise interactions have always had a key role in ecology and evolutionary biology, the recent increase in the amount and availability of biological data has placed a new focus on the complex networks embedded in biological systems. The increased availability of computational tools to store and retrieve biological data has facilitated wide access to these data, not just by biologists but also by specialists from the social sciences, computer science, physics and mathematics. This fusion of interests has led to a burst of research on the properties and consequences of network structure in biological systems. Although traditional measures of network structure and function have started us off on the right foot, an important next step is to create biologically realistic models of network formation, evolution, and function. Here, we review recent applications of network thinking to the evolution of networks at the gene and protein level and to the dynamics and stability of communities. These studies have provided new insights into the organization and function of biological systems by applying existing techniques of network analysis. The current challenge is to recognize the commonalities in evolutionary and ecological applications of network thinking to create a predictive science of biological networks.},

@article{Lustig2015,
abstract = {Abstract Habitat change and fragmentation are considered key drivers of environmental change and biodiversity loss. To understand and mitigate the effects of such spatial disturbances on biological systems, it is critical to quantify changes in landscape pattern. However, the characterization of spatial patterns remains complicated in part because most widely used landscape metrics vary with the amount of usable habitat available in the landscape, and vary with the scale of the spatial data used to calculate them. In this study, we investigate the nature of the relationship between intrinsic characteristics of spatial pattern and extrinsic scale-dependent factors that affect the characterization of landscape patterns. To do so, we used techniques from modern multivariate statistics to disentangle widely used landscape metrics with respect to four landscape components: extent (E), resolution (R), percentage of suitable habitat cover (P), and spatial autocorrelation level (H). Our results highlight those metrics that are less sensitive to change in spatial scale and those that are less correlated. We found, however, significant and complex interactions between intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of landscape patterns that will always complicate researcher's ability to isolate purely landscape pattern driven effects from the effects of changing spatial scale. As such, our study illustrates the need for a more systematic investigation of the relationship between intrinsic characteristics and extrinsic properties to accurately characterize observed landscape patterns.},

Spread is facilitated primarily by human transportation, but there is increasing concern that climate change allows establishment in hitherto unsuitable regions. However, interactions between climate change, crops and pests are complex, and the extent to which crop pests and pathogens have altered their latitudinal ranges in response to global warming is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate an average poleward shift of 2.7±0.8 km yr−1 since 1960, in observations of hundreds of pests and pathogens, but with significant variation in trends among taxonomic groups. Observational bias, where developed countries at high latitudes detect pests earlier than developing countries at low latitudes, would result in an apparent shift towards the Equator. The observed positive latitudinal trends in many taxa support the hypothesis of global warming-driven pest movement.},

abstract = {Biosecurity schemes aim to prevent the introduction of species with a high invasion potential, without unduly restricting personal freedom and commercial activities. But invasive species risk assessments are time consuming, data intensive and expensive. Consequently, resource poor nations cannot implement these schemes. Here we develop a method for creating watch lists using the consistent predictors of invasion success-history of invasion, environmental suitability, and propagule pressure (measured respectively using the Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), environmental modelling, and tourism and trade data). We tested the approach for South Africa, at a national level for various taxa and at a provincial level for plants. Of 884 alien species listed in the GISD, 400 were potential invaders, with most occurring in high risk regions. When alien species in South Africa were evaluated there were many false-negatives (sensitivity of 32{\%} for terrestrial and 40{\%} for marine species), because the GISD is not comprehensive, but few false positives (specificity of 91{\%} for terrestrial and 89{\%} for marine species). The methodology was easy to apply at different political levels, but we found substantial overlaps between the national and provincial watch lists of plants. This simple technique is rapid, easily repeatable, flexible, transparent, works across taxa, and does not require substantial financial or scientific input. It can be used in any region of the world and at various political levels as an initial assessment of key threats. As such it may be an important step in developing biosecurity schemes for resource poor regions.},

This discussion reviews the key criticisms of the native/alien construct, including its spatiotemporally arbitrary character, its disturbingly xenophobic associations, the logical problems of attributing native or alien status to our own species, and the ethical disjunction between the promotion of a multicultural human society and the persecution of 'foreign' species. Given that the native/ alien polarity is a subset of the discredited nature/culture duality, its conceptual foundations seem irredeemably fractured. An alternative framework based on a 'damage criterion' rather than putative biogeographical origins is advocated. {\textcopyright} 2007 SAGE Publications.},

We provide a tutorial for maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and model selection using information theoretics, including a brief treatment of procedures for model comparison, model averaging, and use of data from multiple sources. We discuss the advantages of likelihood estimation, Bayesian analysis, and meta-analysis as ways to accumulate understanding across multiple studies.

abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950-2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

abstract = {All around the globe, humans have greatly altered the abiotic and biotic environment with ever-increasing speed. One defining fea-ture of the Anthropocene epoch 1,2 is the erosion of biogeographical barriers by human-mediated dispersal of species into new regions, where they can naturalize and cause ecological, economic and social damage 3 . So far, no comprehensive analysis of the global accumulation and exchange of alien plant species between conti-nents has been performed, primarily because of a lack of data. Here we bridge this knowledge gap by using a unique global database on the occurrences of naturalized alien plant species in 481 mainland and 362 island regions. In total, 13,168 plant species, correspond-ing to 3.9{\%} of the extant global vascular flora, or approximately the size of the native European flora, have become naturalized some-where on the globe as a result of human activity. North America has accumulated the largest number of naturalized species, whereas the Pacific Islands show the fastest increase in species numbers with respect to their land area. Continents in the Northern Hemisphere have been the major donors of naturalized alien species to all other continents. Our results quantify for the first time the extent of plant naturalizations worldwide, and illustrate the urgent need for globally integrated efforts to control, manage and understand the spread of alien species. The magnitude of impacts caused by alien species on native biota and human societies is increasing rapidly 3},

abstract = {Classic parametric statistical significance tests, such as analysis of variance and least squares regression, are widely used by researchers in many disciplines, including psychology. For classic parametric tests to produce accurate results, the assumptions underlying them (e.g., normality and homoscedasticity) must be satisfied. These assumptions are rarely met when analyzing real data. The use of classic parametric methods with violated assumptions can result in the inaccurate computation of p values, effect sizes, and confidence intervals. This may lead to substantive errors in the interpretation of data. Many modern robust statistical methods alleviate the problems inherent in using parametric methods with violated assumptions, yet modern methods are rarely used by researchers. The authors examine why this is the case, arguing that most researchers are unaware of the serious limitations of classic methods and are unfamiliar with modern alternatives. A range of modern robust and rank-based significance tests suitable for analyzing a wide range of designs is introduced. Practical advice on conducting modern analyses using software such as SPSS, SAS, and R is provided. The authors conclude by discussing robust effect size indices.},

abstract = {Aim  The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) is a widely used statistic for assessing the discriminatory capacity of species distribution models. Here, I used simulated data to examine the interdependence of the AUC and classical discrimination measures (sensitivity and specificity) derived for the application of a threshold. I shall further exemplify with simulated data the implications of using the AUC to evaluate potential versus realized distribution models. Innovation  After applying the threshold that makes sensitivity and specificity equal, a strong relationship between the AUC and these two measures was found. This result is corroborated with real data. On the other hand, the AUC penalizes the models that estimate potential distributions (the regions where the species could survive and reproduce due to the existence of suitable environmental conditions), and favours those that estimate realized distributions (the regions where the species actually lives). Main conclusions  Firstly, the independence of the AUC from the threshold selection may be irrelevant in practice. This result also emphasizes the fact that the AUC assumes nothing about the relative costs of errors of omission and commission. However, in most real situations this premise may not be optimal. Measures derived from a contingency table for different cost ratio scenarios, together with the ROC curve, may be more informative than reporting just a single AUC value. Secondly, the AUC is only truly informative when there are true instances of absence available and the objective is the estimation of the realized distribution. When the potential distribution is the goal of the research, the AUC is not an appropriate performance measure because the weight of commission errors is much lower than that of omission errors.},

abstract = {During the establishment phase of a biological invasion, popula-tion dynamics are strongly influenced by Allee effects and stochastic dynamics, both of which may lead to extinction of low-density pop-ulations. Allee effects refer to a decline in population growth rate with a decline in abundance and can arise from various mechanisms. Strategies to eradicate newly established populations should focus on either enhancing Allee effects or suppressing populations below Allee thresholds, such that extinction proceeds without further inter-vention. The spread phase of invasions results from the coupling of population growth with dispersal. Reaction-diffusion is the simplest form of spread, resulting in continuous expansion and asymptotically constant radial rates of spread. However, spread of most nonindige-nous insects is characterized by occasional long-distance dispersal, which results in the formation of isolated colonies that grow, co-alesce, and greatly increase spread. Allee effects also affect spread, generally in a negative fashion. Efforts to slow, stop, or reverse spread should incorporate the spread dynamics unique to the target species.},

abstract = {Aim The aims of this study are to resolve terminological confusion around different types of species–area relationships (SARs) and their delimitation from species sampling relationships (SSRs), to provide a comprehensive overview of models and analytical methods for SARs, to evaluate these theoretically and empirically, and to suggest a more consistent approach for the treatment of species–area data.Location Curonian Spit in north-west Russia and archipelagos world-wide.Methods First, I review various typologies for SARs and SSRs as well as mathematical models, fitting procedures and goodness-of-fit measures applied to SARs. This results in a list of 23 function types, which are applicable both for untransformed (S) and for log-transformed (log S) species richness. Then, example data sets for nested plots in continuous vegetation (n = 14) and islands (n = 6) are fitted to a selection of 12 function types (linear, power, logarithmic, saturation, sigmoid) both for S and for log S. The suitability of these models is assessed with Akaike's information criterion for S and log S, and with a newly proposed metric that addresses extrapolation capability.Results SARs, which provide species numbers for different areas and have no upper asymptote, must be distinguished from SSRs, which approach the species richness of one single area asymptotically. Among SARs, nested plots in continuous ecosystems, non-nested plots in continuous ecosystems, and isolates can be distinguished. For the SARs of the empirical data sets, the normal and quadratic power functions as well as two of the sigmoid functions (Lomolino, cumulative beta-P) generally performed well. The normal power function (fitted for S) was particularly suitable for predicting richness values over ten-fold increases in area. Linear, logarithmic, convex saturation and logistic functions generally were inappropriate. However, the two sigmoid models produced unstable results with arbitrary parameter estimates, and the quadratic power function resulted in decreasing richness values for large areas.Main conclusions Based on theoretical considerations and empirical results, I suggest that the power law should be used to describe and compare any type of SAR while at the same time testing whether the exponent z changes with spatial scale. In addition, one should be aware that power-law parameters are significantly influenced by methodology.},

We found that by 2080, 58 ± 2.6{\{}{\%}{\}} of the species would lose suitable climate in protected areas, whereas losses affected 63 ± 2.1{\{}{\%}{\}} of the species of European concern occurring in Natura 2000 areas. Protected areas are expected to retain climatic suitability for species better than unprotected areas (P {\textless} 0.001), but Natura 2000 areas retain climate suitability for species no better and sometimes less effectively than unprotected areas. The risk is high that ongoing efforts to conserve Europe's biodiversity are jeopardized by climate change. New policies are required to avert this risk.},

abstract = {Human development of freshwater ecosystems has lead to drastic changes in freshwater fish faunas, including the loss of many native species and the gain of non-natives. Typically conservation ecologists view these two opposing forces as contributing to biological homogenization, and consider homogenization as one of the principle negative consequences of urbanization. However, homogenization is only one outcome out of many that can result from the loss and gain of species. In particular, it is possible for invasions and extinctions to lead to differentiation; a process whereby two (or more) regions become less similar to one another through time. Using the freshwater fishes of California, we show that urbanization is highly positively correlated to both the endangerment of native fish and the invasion of non-native fish within watersheds. Despite this, the fish faunas of California's watersheds have differentiated from one another through time. Furthermore, the degree of differentiation is positively correlated with measures of urbanization, which is contrary to expectation. We suggest that this result reflects: (1) the haphazard manner in which non-native fishes have been introduced into California watersheds, (2) the difficulty that both native and non-native fishes have in expanding their geographical ranges, and (3) the continued presence of vestiges of formerly distinct regional faunas. This pattern of differentiation among watersheds is likely a matter of scale, as previous work on freshwater fishes has demonstrated homogenization at both larger and smaller spatial scales. In addition the observed pattern is probably a short-term (temporal) phenomena and will disappear with continued invasion and extinction. We suggest that similar patterns may occur for other taxa that have limited natural dispersal abilities and that are idiosyncratically released as non-natives via human activities (e.g. herptiles). ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Climate change and biological invasions are key processes affecting global biodiversity, yet their effects have usually been considered separately. Here, we emphasise that global warming has enabled alien species to expand into regions in which they previously could not survive and reproduce. Based on a review of climate-mediated biological invasions of plants, invertebrates, fishes and birds, we discuss the ways in which climate change influences biological invasions. We emphasise the role of alien species in a more dynamic context of shifting species' ranges and changing communities. Under these circumstances, management practices regarding the occurrence of 'new' species could range from complete eradication to tolerance and even consideration of the 'new' species as an enrichment of local biodiversity and key elements to maintain ecosystem services.},

abstract = {The power law is found for density distributions the chaotic systems of most different nature for (physical, geophysical, biological, economical, social, etc.) on the basis of the maximum entropy principle for the Renyi entropy. Its exponent q is expressed as a function q(??) of the Renyi parameter ??. The difference between the Renyi and Boltzmann-Shannon entropies (a modified Lyapunov functional ??R) for the same power-law distribution is negative and as a function of ?? has a well-defined minimum at ??* which remains within the narrow range from 1.5 to 3 when varying other characteristic parameters of any concrete systems. Relevant variations of the exponent q(??*) are found within the range 1-3.5. The same range of observable values of q is typical for the various applications where the power-law distribution takes place. It is known under the following names: `triangular or trapezoidal' (in physics and technics), `Gutenberg-Richter law' (in geophysics), `Zipf-Pareto law' (in economics and the humanities), `Lotka low' (in science of science), etc. As the negative ??R indicates self-organization of the system, the negative minimum of ??R corresponds to the most self-organized state. Thus, the comparison between the calculated range of variations of q(??*) and observable values of the exponent q testifies that the most self-organized states are as a rule realized regardless of the nature of a chaotic system.},

abstract = {“Trends in invasive alien species” is one of only two indicators of threat to biodiversity that form part of the Convention on Biological Diversity's (CBD) framework for monitoring progress toward its “2010 target” (i.e., the commitment to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss). To date, however, there is no fully developed indicator for invasive alien species (IAS) that combines trends, derived from a standard set of methods, across species groups, ecosystems, and regions. Here we provide a rationale for the form and characteristics of an indicator of trends in IAS that will meet the 2010 framework goal and targets for this indicator.We suggest single and composite indicators that include problem-status and management-status measures that are designed to be flexible, readily disaggregated, and as far as possible draw on existing data. The single indicators at national and global scales are number of IAS and numbers of operational management plans for IAS. Global trends in IAS are measured as the progress of nations toward the targets of stabilizing IAS numbers and the implementation of IAS management plans. The proposed global indicator thus represents a minimum information set that most directly addresses the indicator objective and simultaneously aims to maximize national participation. This global indicator now requires testing to assess its accuracy, sensitivity, and tractability. Although it may not be possible to achieve the desired objective for a global indicator of biological invasion by 2010 as comprehensively as desired, it seems possible to obtain trend estimates for a component of the taxa, ecosystems, and regions involved. Importantly, current indicator development initiatives will also contribute to developing the mechanisms necessary for monitoring global trends in IAS beyond 2010},

To the extent that interactions among introduced species are depicted at all, the emphasis has been on negative interactions, primarily resource competition and interference. However, a literature search reveals that introduced species frequently interact with one another and that facilitative interactions are at least as common as detrimental ones. The population significance of these interactions has rarely been determined, but a great variety of types of direct and indirect interactions among individuals of different nonindigenous species is observed, and many are plausibly believed to have consequences at the population level. In particular, mutualisms between plants and the animals that disperse and/or pollinate them and modification of habitat by both animals and plants seem common and often important in facilitating invasions. There is little evidence that interference among introduced species at levels currently observed significantly impedes further invasions, and synergistic interactions among invaders may well lead to accelerated impacts on native ecosystems – an invasional ‘meltdown' process.},

Predicting which one in hundreds of potential invasive fruit fly species is most likely to establish in a region presents a significant challenge, but can be facilitated using a self organising map (SOM), which is able to analyse species associations to rank large numbers of species simultaneously with an index of establishment. A global presence/absence dataset including 180 economically significant fruit fly species in 118 countries was analysed using a SOM. We compare and contrast ranked lists from six countries selected from each continent, and also show that those countries geographically close were clustered together by the SOM analysis because they have similar fruit fly assemblages. These closely clustered countries therefore represent greater threats to each other as sources of invasive fruit fly species. Finally, we indicate how this SOM method could be utilized as an initial screen to support prioritizing fruit fly species for further research into their potential to invade a region.},

For one-third of the insects established in Switzerland and Austria, the region of origin is unclear. Others come mainly from North America, Asia and the Mediterranean region. Among the intercepted insects, 40{\%} were associated with commodities from Asia, 32{\%} from Europe and only 2{\%} from North America. Sternorrhyncha, Coleoptera and Psocoptera were particularly well represented in the alien fauna compared to the native fauna. In the interception database, Sternorrhyncha were also well represented but Diptera accounted for the highest number of records. Sap feeders and detritivores were the dominant feeding niches in the alien insect fauna. In contrast, external defoliators, stem borers, gall makers, root feeders, predators and parasitoids were underrepresented. Nearly 40{\%} of the alien insects in Switzerland and Austria live only indoors. Another 15{\%} live outdoors but exclusively or predominantly on exotic plants. Less than 20{\%} are found mainly in ‘natural' environments. The majority of introductions of alien insects in Europe are associated with the international trade in ornamental plants. An economic impact was found for 40{\%} of the alien insects in Switzerland and Austria, whereas none is known to have an ecological impact. The implications of these observations for further studies and the management of alien species in Europe are discussed.},

abstract = {Distribution models are used to predict the likelihood of occurrence or abundance of a species at locations where census data are not available. An integral part of modelling is the testing of model performance. We compared different schemes and measures for testing model performance using 79 species from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The four testing schemes we compared featured increasing independence between test and training data: resubstitution, random data hold-out and two spatially segregated data hold-out designs. The different testing measures also addressed different levels of information content in the dependent variable: regression R2 for absolute abundance, squared correlation coefficient r2 for relative abundance and AUC/Somer's D for presence/absence. We found that higher levels of independence between test and training data lead to lower assessments of prediction accuracy. Even for data collected independently, spatial autocorrelation leads to dependence between random hold-out test data and training data, and thus to inflated measures of model performance. While there is a general awareness of the importance of autocorrelation to model building and hypothesis testing, its consequences via violation of independence between training and testing data have not been addressed systematically and comprehensively before. Furthermore, increasing information content (from correctly classifying presence/absence, to predicting relative abundance, to predicting absolute abundance) leads to decreasing predictive performance. The current tests for presence/absence distribution models are typically overly optimistic because a) the test and training data are not independent and b) the correct classification of presence/absence has a relatively low information content and thus capability to address ecological and conservation questions compared to a prediction of abundance. Meaningful evaluation of model performance requires testing on spatially independent data, if the intended application of the model is to predict into new geographic or climatic space, which arguably is the case for most applications of distribution models.},

@article{Nakagawa2015,
abstract = {* Meta-analysis has become a standard way of summarizing empirical studies in many fields, including ecology and evolution. In ecology and evolution, meta-analyses comparing two groups (usually experimental and control groups) have almost exclusively focused on comparing the means, using standardized metrics such as Cohen's / Hedges' d or the response ratio. * However, an experimental treatment may not only affect the mean but also the variance. Investigating differences in the variance between two groups may be informative, especially when a treatment influences the variance in addition to or instead of the mean. * In this paper, we propose the effect size statistic lnCVR (the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation, CV, from two groups), which enables us to meta-analytically compare differences between the variability of two groups. We illustrate the use of lnCVR with examples from ecology and evolution. * Further, as an alternative approach to the use of lnCVR, we propose the combined use of ln s (the log standard deviation) and lnx¯ (the log mean) in a hierarchical (linear mixed) model. The use of ln s with lnx¯ overcomes potential limitations of lnCVR and it provides a more flexible, albeit more complex, way to examine variation beyond two-group comparisons. Relevantly, we also refer to the potential use of ln s and lnCV (the log CV) in the context of comparative analysis. * Our approaches to compare variability could be applied to already published meta-analytic data sets that compare two-group means to uncover potentially overlooked effects on the variance. Additionally, our approaches should be applied to future meta-analyses, especially when one suspects a treatment has an effect not only on the mean, but also on the variance. Notably, the application of the proposed methods extends beyond the fields of ecology and evolution.},

abstract = {Managing biological invasions relies on good global coverage of species distributions. Accurate information on alien species distributions, obtained from international policy and cross-border co-operation, is required to evaluate trans-boundary and trading partnership risks. However, a standardized approach for systematically monitoring alien species and tracking biological invasions is still lacking. This Perspective presents a vision for global observation and monitoring of biological invasions. We show how the architecture for tracking biological invasions is provided by a minimum information set of Essential Variables, global collaboration on data sharing and infrastructure, and strategic contributions by countries. We show how this novel, synthetic approach to an observation system for alien species provides a tangible and attainable solution to delivering the information needed to slow the rate of new incursions and reduce the impacts of invaders. We identify three Essential Variables for Invasion Monitoring; alien species occurrence, species alien status and alien species impact. We outline how delivery of this minimum information set by joint, complementary contributions from countries and global community initiatives is possible. Country contributions are made feasible using a modular approach where all countries are able to participate and strategically build their contributions to a global information set over time. The vision we outline will deliver wide-ranging benefits to countries and international efforts to slow the rate of biological invasions and minimize their environmental impacts. These benefits will accrue over time as global coverage and information on alien species increases.},

abstract = {Alien species indicators provide vital information to the biodiversity policy sector on the status-quo and trends of biological invasions and on the efficacy of response measures. Applicable at different geographical scales and organizational levels, alien species indicators struggle with data availability and quality. Based on policy needs and previous work on the global scale, we here present a set of six alien species indicators for Europe, which capture complementary facets of biological invasions in Europe: (a) an combined index of invasion trends, (b) an indicator on pathways of invasions, (c) the Red List Index of Invasive Alien Species (IAS), (d) an indicator of IAS impacts on ecosystem services, (e) trends in incidence of livestock diseases and (f) an indicator on costs for alien species management and research. Each of these indicators has its particular strengths and shortcomings, but combined they allow for a nuanced understanding of the status and trends of biological invasions in Europe. We found that the scale and impact of biological invasions are steadily increasing across all impact indicators, although societal response in recent years has increased. The Red List Index is fit-for-purpose and demonstrates that overall extinction risks (here shown for amphibians in Europe) are increasing. Introduction pathway dynamics have changed, with some pathways decreasing in relevance (e.g., biological control agents) and others increasing (e.g., horticultural trade) providing a leverage for targeted policy and stakeholder response. The IAS indicators presented here for the first time on a continental basis serve as a starting point for future improvements, and as a basis for monitoring the efficacy of the recent EU legislation of IAS. This will need a better workflow for data collection and management. To achieve this, all main actors must work toward improving the interoperability among existing databases and between data holders.},

abstract = {Environmental decision-making is complicated by the complexity of natural systems and the often competing needs of multiple stakeholders. Modelling tools are often used to assist at various stages of the environmental decision-making process. If such models are to provide effective decision support, the uncertainties associated with all aspects of the decision-making process need to be taken into account explicitly. However, as models become more complex in order to better represent integrated environmental, social and economic systems, achieving this goal becomes more difficult. Some of the important issues that need to be addressed in relation to the incorporation of uncertainty in environmental decision-making processes include (i) the development of appropriate risk-based performance criteria that are understood and accepted by a range of disciplines, (ii) the development of methods for quantifying the uncertainty associated with human input, (iii) the development of approaches and strategies for increasing the computational efficiency of integrated models, optimization methods and methods for estimating risk-based performance measures, and (iv) the development of an integrated framework that enables all sources of uncertainty to be incorporated in the environmental decision-making process.},

@article{Carthey2014,
abstract = {The invasion of alien species into areas beyond their native ranges is having profound effects on ecosystems around the world. In particular, novel alien predators are causing rapid extinctions or declines in many native prey species, and these impacts are generally attributed to ecological na{\"{i}}vet{\'{e}} or the failure to recognise a novel enemy and respond appropriately due to a lack of experience. Despite a large body of research concerning the recognition of alien predation risk by native prey, the literature lacks an extensive review of na{\"{i}}vet{\'{e}} theory that specifically asks how na{\"{i}}vet{\'{e}} between novel pairings of alien predators and native prey disrupts our classical understanding of predator-prey ecological theory. Here we critically review both classic and current theory relating to predator-prey interactions between both predators and prey with shared evolutionary histories, and those that are ecologically 'mismatched' through the outcomes of biological invasions. The review is structured around the multiple levels of na{\"{i}}vet{\'{e}} framework of Banks {\&} Dickman (2007), and concepts and examples are discussed as they relate to each stage in the process from failure to recognise a novel predator (Level 1 na{\"{i}}vet{\'{e}}), through to appropriate (Level 2) and effective (Level 3) antipredator responses. We discuss the relative contributions of recognition, cue types and the implied risk of cues used by novel alien and familiar native predators, to the probability that prey will recognise a novel predator. We then cover the antipredator response types available to prey and the factors that predict whether these responses will be appropriate or effective against novel alien and familiar native predators. In general, the level of na{\"{i}}vet{\'{e}} of native prey can be predicted by the degree of novelty (in terms of appearance, behaviour or habitat use) of the alien predator compared to native predators with which prey are experienced. Appearance in this sense includes cue types, spatial distribution and implied risk of cues, whilst behaviour and habitat use include hunting modes and the habitat domain of the predator. Finally, we discuss whether the antipredator response can occur without recognition per se, for example in the case of morphological defences, and then consider a potential extension of the multiple levels of na{\"{i}}vet{\'{e}} framework. The review concludes with recommendations for the design and execution of na{\"{i}}vet{\'{e}} experiments incorporating the key concepts and issues covered here. This review aims to critique and combine classic ideas about predator-prey interactions with current na{\"{i}}vet{\'{e}} theory, to further develop the multiple levels of na{\"{i}}vet{\'{e}} framework, and to suggest the most fruitful avenues for future research.},

We compared two such approaches, sensitivity and specificity with area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC) for the evaluation of CT colonography for the detection of polyps, either with or without computer assisted detection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In a multireader multicase study of 10 readers and 107 cases we compared sensitivity and specificity, using radiological reporting of the presence or absence of polyps, to ROC AUC calculated from confidence scores concerning the presence of polyps. Both methods were assessed against a reference standard. Here we focus on five readers, selected to illustrate issues in design and analysis. We compared diagnostic measures within readers, showing that differences in results are due to statistical methods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Reader performance varied widely depending on whether sensitivity and specificity or ROC AUC was used. There were problems using confidence scores; in assigning scores to all cases; in use of zero scores when no polyps were identified; the bimodal non-normal distribution of scores; fitting ROC curves due to extrapolation beyond the study data; and the undue influence of a few false positive results. Variation due to use of different ROC methods exceeded differences between test results for ROC AUC.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The confidence scores recorded in our study violated many assumptions of ROC AUC methods, rendering these methods inappropriate. The problems we identified will apply to other detection studies using confidence scores. We found sensitivity and specificity were a more reliable and clinically appropriate method to compare diagnostic tests.},

IPPC standards now demonstrate clearly that the risks posed by any organism that is directly or indirectly injurious to cultivated or uncultivated plants can be assessed and managed under the IPPC. Since the IPPC, unlike the CBD, constitutes an international legal instrument recognised by the World Trade Organization, greater protection from the introduction of IAS is now available. However, phytosanitary measures can only be enacted if they can be justifi ed by risk analysis and we outline some novel strategies to improve the assessment and management of the risks posed by IAS, highlighting some of the key challenges which remain.},

The SOM is related to the classical vector quantization (VQ), which is used extensively in digital signal processing and transmission. Like in VQ, the SOM represents a distribution of input data items using a finite set of models. In the SOM, however, these models are automatically associated with the nodes of a regular (usually two-dimensional) grid in an orderly fashion such that more similar models become automatically associated with nodes that are adjacent in the grid, whereas less similar models are situated farther away from each other in the grid. This organization, a kind of similarity diagram of the models, makes it possible to obtain an insight into the topographic relationships of data, especially of high-dimensional data items. If the data items belong to certain predetermined classes, the models (and the nodes) can be calibrated according to these classes. An unknown input item is then classified according to that node, the model of which is most similar with it in some metric used in the construction of the SOM. A new finding introduced in this paper is that an input item can even more accurately be represented by a linear mixture of a few best-matching models. This becomes possible by a least-squares fitting procedure where the coefficients in the linear mixture of models are constrained to nonnegative values.},

abstract = {Biological invasions are caused by human-mediated extra-range dispersal and, unlike natural extra-range dispersal, are often the result of multiple introductions from multiple sources to multiple locations. The processes and opportunities that result in propagules moving from one area to another can be used more broadly to differentiate all types of extra-range dispersal. By examining key properties of dispersal pathways (notably propagule pressure, genetic diversity and the potential for simultaneous movement of coevolved species), the establishment and evolutionary trajectories of extra-range dispersal can be better understood. Moreover, elucidation of the mechanistic properties of dispersal pathways is crucial for scientists and managers who wish to assist, minimise or prevent future movements of organisms. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Wilson2007,
abstract = {A prime aim of invasion biology is to predict which species will become invasive, but retrospective analyses have so far failed to develop robust generalizations. This is because many biological, environmental, and anthropogenic factors interact to determine the distribution of invasive species. However, in this paper we also argue that many analyses of invasiveness have been flawed by not considering several fundamental issues: (1) the range size of an invasive species depends on how much time it has had to spread (its residence time); (2) the range size and spread rate are mediated by the total extent of suitable (i.e. potentially invasible) habitat; and (3) the range size and spread rate depend on the frequency and intensity of introductions (propagule pressure), the position of founder populations in relation to the potential range, and the spatial distribution of the potential range. We explored these considerations using a large set of invasive alien plant species in South Africa for which accurate distribution data and other relevant information were available. Species introduced earlier and those with larger potential ranges had larger current range sizes, but we found no significant effect of the spatial distribution of potential ranges on current range sizes, and data on propagule pressure were largely unavailable. However, crucially, we showed that: (1) including residence time and potential range always significantly increases the explanatory power of the models; and (2) residence time and potential range can affect which factors emerge as significant determinants of invasiveness. Therefore, analyses not including potential range and residence time can come to misleading conclusions. When these factors were taken into account, we found that nitrogen-fixing plants and plants invading arid regions have spread faster than other species, but these results were phylogenetically constrained. We also show that, when analysed in the context of residence time and potential range, variation in range size among invasive species is implicitly due to variation in spread rates, and, that by explicitly assuming a particular model of spread, it is possible to estimate changes in the rates of plant invasions through time. We believe that invasion biology can develop generalizations that are useful for management, but only in the context of a suitable null model.},

This paper describes the work undertaken by the EU 7th Framework project PRATIQUE (Enhancements of Pest Risk Analysis Techniques) to develop guidance for this component of PRA. Firstly, there is a guide to rating the suitability of the climate in the PRA area using qualitative methods. Secondly, a Decision-support scheme (DSS) has been created to assist analysts in deciding whether to map climatic suitability, and to guide the selection of the most appropriate method from the large number available. The process of selecting a climatic mapping method is based on a review of the pest's climatic responses and distribution. A spreadsheet provides a comparison of the potential problems that can arise, depending on the mapping method and on the amount and quality of available data. Diagrams are provided to help choose the location data category that best represents the possible biases in the known distribution of the pest. A second spreadsheet provides general information on the differences and similarities of each method in terms of categories such as functionality, ease of use and quality assurance. A variety of data, tools and supporting documents are available as appendices to the DSS. All of the tools and guides are freely available online.},

@article{Hulme2011,
abstract = {Most researchers working in applied ecology are aware that much of what is published in leading ecological and environmental science journals makes little difference to the day-to-day management of species and ecosystems (Nature 2007). In recent years, several editorials have made this point and attempted to identify a way forward to bridge ‘The Great Divide' (Born, Boreux {\&} Lawes 2009; Milner-Gulland et al. 2010; Memmott et al. 2010). The onus has largely been on the scientific community to communicate the value of its science more clearly, become increasingly involved in extension activities and, heaven forbid, step down from their ivory towers and get their hands dirty. Yet the reality is that many scientists are doing this already, several very successfully (Possingham 2009). A more serious concern is that academic journals are simply not the best medium to communicate practical messages to a wide audience who need specific solutions to particular problems that have to be delivered on a tight budget. We should not be surprised; much academic research aims to be innovative, internationally competitive and globally relevant – aims which are not always congruent with finding practical solutions. It is against these criteria that many editorial decisions regarding whether or not to accept a paper for publication are made. Irrespective of how much hand-wringing might take place among editors this situation is unlikely to change as publishers judge the viability of journals using bibliometric indices and numbers of institutional subscriptions. Yet, potentially there is another way. Communication is a two-way street, even if much of the academic traffic is heading in one direction with no clear destination. So how do scientific researchers hear about the concerns and needs of those tackling problems in the field? Surveys of stakeholders are certainly one way to confirm that they feel the scientific community is not listening to them (e.g. Andreu, Vil{\`{a}} {\&} Hulme 2009) but questionnaires do not address the problem. An alternative is to provide an opportunity within the pages of academic journals for non-standard pieces to be written by individuals who have a different perspective on what is needed in applied ecology research and whether the papers published in academic journals get anywhere near it. With this aim, the Journal of Applied Ecology launches its first ‘Practitioner's Perspective'. These ‘prick our conscience' pieces can be contributed by anyone who has a strong opinion on the current state of applied ecology research, whether academic or not, as long as they can provide an original perspective and a constructive way forward. Although practitioners have been identified as a distinct group of actors in applied ecology that ‘buy land, put up fences, set fires, put out fires, lobby politicians, negotiate with farmers, spray invasive weeds, poison rats and guard against poachers' (Nature 2007), we are not placing restrictions on who is or is not a ‘practitioner'. Thus, we welcome pieces from academics (at least those with a bit of dirt under their fingernails) as well as civil servants, environmental consultants, park managers and environmental lobbyists. The truth is we are unsure what to expect in terms of submissions under this new feature, hopefully provocative pieces from writers whose voices are rarely heard in our journal. To kick-start this initiative we have commissioned a few articles that might give a flavour of the pieces we would like to see published in the future. Our greatest challenge to date has been to prevent these pieces from becoming advertorials for the activities of NGOs, conservation groups or consultancies. This is certainly not what we want, but we do welcome examples of best practice that may not have made it into the wider academic literature. The first Practitioner's Perspective appears in this issue (Goulson et al. 2011) and illustrates the viewpoint of the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, although the lead author is a senior academic at Stirling University, UK. Hopefully, in addition to highlighting how science informs the conservation of bumblebees it will challenge readers to consider what more needs to be done. We encourage future submissions under Practitioner's Perspectives but please be sure to contact the Editors to discuss your piece beforehand. There is no prescribed structure to Practitioner's Perspectives apart from our hope that they will be thought-provoking and challenge the science community to consider the perspectives of those individuals addressing applied ecological issues. However, authors may wish to consider covering the activities of the individual or organization with regard to ecological management, the key issues they are addressing (see Sutherland et al. 2006, 2009 for a range of key questions), the extent to which applied ecological research has supported their activities (if at all), how future research might assist them to address ecological problems more effectively and how this might best be achieved (e.g. through greater dialogue, joint projects, new research techniques etc.).

abstract = {Beta diversity is an important concept used to describe turnover in species composition across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and it underpins much of conservation theory and practice. Although substantial progress has been made in the mathematical and terminological treatment of different measures of beta diversity, there has been little conceptual synthesis of potential scale dependence of beta diversity with increasing spatial grain and geographic extent of sampling. Here, we evaluate different conceptual approaches to the spatial scaling of beta diversity, interpreted from ‘fixed' and ‘varying' perspectives of spatial grain and extent. We argue that a ‘sliding window' perspective, in which spatial grain and extent covary, is an informative way to conceptualize community differentiation across scales. This concept more realistically reflects the varying empirical approaches that researchers adopt in field sampling and the varying scales of landscape perception by different organisms. Scale dependence in beta diversity has broad implications for emerging fields in ecology and biogeography, such as the integration of fine-resolution ecogenomic data with large-scale macroecological studies, as well as for guiding appropriate management responses to threats to biodiversity operating at different spatial scales.},

Here, we introduce two bottom-up hierarchical approaches that exploit an information theoretic proximity measure to explore the nonlinear boundaries between clusters and extract data structures further than the second order statistics. Experimental results on both artificial and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to conventional and information theoretic clustering algorithms reported in the literature, especially in detecting the true number of clusters.},

The interactions between plants and their natural enemies are influenced by environmental conditions and thus global warming and climate change could affect CPP ranges and impact. Obser- vations of changing CPP distributions over the twentieth century suggest that growing agricultural production and trade have been most important in disseminating CPPs, but there is some evidence for a latitudinal bias in range shifts that indicates a global warming signal. Species distribution models us- ing climatic variables as drivers suggest that ranges will shift latitudinally in the future. The rapid spread of the Colorado potato beetle across Eurasia illustrates the importance of evolutionary adaptation, host distribution, and migration patterns in affecting the predictions of climate-based species dis- tribution models.

Several authors have used these terms in proposing schemes for conceptualizing the sequence of events from introduction to invasion, but often imprecisely, erroneously or in contradictory ways. This greatly complicates the formulation of robust generalizations in invasion ecology. Based on an extensive and critical survey of the literature we defined a minimum set of key terms related to a graphic scheme which conceptualizes the naturalization/invasion process. Introduction means that the plant (or its propagule) has been transported by humans across a major geographical barrier. Naturalization starts when abiotic and biotic barriers to survival are surmounted and when various barriers to regular reproduction are overcome. Invasion further requires that introduced plants produce reproductive offspring in areas distant from sites of introduction (approximate scales: {\textgreater} 100 m over {\textless} 50 years for taxa spreading by seeds and other propagules; {\textgreater} 6 m/3 years for taxa spreading by roots, rhizomes, stolons or creeping stems). Taxa that can cope with the abiotic environment and biota in the general area may invade disturbed, seminatural communities. Invasion of successionally mature, undisturbed communities usually requires that the alien taxon overcomes a different category of barriers. We propose that the term ‘invasive' should be used without any inference to environmental or economic impact. Terms like ‘pests' and ‘weeds' are suitable labels for the 50–80{\%} of invaders that have harmful effects. About 10{\%} of invasive plants that change the character, condition, form, or nature of ecosystems over substantial areas may be termed ‘transformers'.},

abstract = {"Trends in invasive alien species" is one of only two indicators of threat to biodiversity that form part of the Convention on Biological Diversity's (CBD) framework for monitoring progress toward its "2010 target" (i.e., the commitment to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss). To date, however, there is no fully developed indicator for invasive alien species (IAS) that combines trends, derived from a standard set of methods, across species groups, ecosystems, and regions. Here we provide a rationale for the form and characteristics of an indicator of trends in IAS that will meet the 2010 framework goal and targets for this indicator. We suggest single and composite indicators that include problem-status and management-status measures that are designed to be flexible, readily disaggregated, and as far as possible draw on existing data. The single indicators at national and global scales are number of IAS and numbers of operational management plans for IAS. Global trends in IAS are measured as the progress of nations toward the targets of stabilizing IAS numbers and the implementation of IAS management plans. The proposed global indicator thus represents a minimum information set that most directly addresses the indicator objective and simultaneously aims to maximize national participation. This global indicator now requires testing to assess its accuracy, sensitivity, and tractability. Although it may not be possible to achieve the desired objective for a global indicator of biological invasion by 2010 as comprehensively as desired, it seems possible to obtain trend estimates for a component of the taxa, ecosystems, and regions involved. Importantly, current indicator development initiatives will also contribute to developing the mechanisms necessary for monitoring global trends in IAS beyond 2010.},

abstract = {Aim To quantify the relative importance of propagule pressure, climate- matching and host availability for the invasion of agricultural pest arthropods in Europe and to forecast newly emerging pest species and European areas with the highest risk of arthropod invasion under current climate and a future climate scenario (A1F1). Location Europe. Methods We quantified propagule pressure, climate-matching and host avail- ability by aggregating large global databases for trade, European arthropod interceptions, Koeppen–Geiger world climate classification (including the A1F1 climate change scenario until 2100) and host plant distributions for 118 quarantine arthropod species. Results As expected, all the three factors, propagule pressure, climate suitability and host availability, significantly explained quarantine arthropod invasions in Europe, but the propagule pressure only had a positive effect on invasion suc- cess when considered together with climate suitability and host availability. Cli- mate change according to the A1F1 scenario generally increased the climate suitability of north-eastern European countries and reduced the climate suitability of central European countries for pest arthropod invasions. Main conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that prop- agule pressure interacts with other factors to drive invasions and is not alone sufficient to explain arthropod establishment patterns. European countries with more suitable climate and large agricultural areas of suitable host plants for pest arthropods should thus be more vigilant about introduction pathways. Moreover, efforts to reduce the propagule pressure, such as preventing pests from entering pathways and strengthening border controls, will become more important in north-eastern Europe in the future as the climate becomes more favourable to arthropod invasions.},

Seven methods which can give the relative contribution and/or the contribution profile of the input factors were compared: (i) the 'PaD' (for Partial Derivatives) method consists in a calculation of the partial derivatives of the output according to the input variables; (ii) the 'Weights' method is a computation using the connection weights; (iii) the 'Perturb' method corresponds to a perturbation of the input variables; (iv) the 'Profile' method is a successive variation of one input variable while the others are kept constant at a fixed value; (v) the 'classical stepwise' method is an observation of the change in the error value when an adding (forward) or an elimination (backward) step of the input variables is operated; (vi) 'Improved stepwise a' uses the same principle as the classical stepwise, but the elimination of the input occurs when the network is trained, the connection weights corresponding to the input variable studied is also eliminated; (vii) 'Improved stepwise b' involves the network being trained and fixed step by step, one input variable at its mean value to note the consequences on the error. The data tested in this study concerns the prediction of the density of brown trout spawning redds using habitat characteristics. The PaD method was found to be the most useful as it gave the most complete results, followed by the Profile method that gave the contribution profile of the input variables. The Perturb method allowed a good classification of the input parameters as well as the Weights method that has been simplified but these two methods lack stability. Next came the two improved stepwise methods (a and b) that both gave exactly the same result but the contributions were not sufficiently expressed. Finally, the classical stepwise methods gave the poorest results. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

However, it also has the more fundamental weakness of failing to balance different kinds of misdiagnoses effectively. This is not merely an aspect of the inevitable arbitrariness in choosing a performance measure, but is a core property of the way the AUC is defined.

@article{Eschen2014,
abstract = {The trade in woody plants for planting (WP4P) is a major pathway for the introduction of alien tree pests and diseases into Europe. Pest risk analyses are important tools to prevent such introductions, but they target recognised pests, their hosts and commodities that are likely to vector them. Moreover, the perception of risk partially depends on expert judgement. Our aim was to provide an objective assessment of the likelihood of establishment and potential sources of invasive species. We analysed distribution data for 1009 invertebrate pests and pathogens of woody hosts in 344 regions. Countries and regions with similar pest assemblages were identified for each organism group using hierarchical cluster analysis and the likelihood of establishment of those species was calculated as the frequency of each species in countries within the cluster containing EU and EFTA countries ("EU countries"). Meaningful European clusters were formed for all organism groups, except oomycetes, and species were ranked by risk to each EU country. The non-EU regions with the most similar pest assemblages to the EU are the Balkan countries, Japan, Kazakhstan, New Zealand, Turkey, Ukraine, parts of China, Russia and the USA, and EPPO countries, indicating that these may be the origin of new pests and pathogens. The quality of the assessment of the likelihood of establishment depends on the quality of distribution data for pests and pathogens, but data quality varies between countries and organism groups and records are often historical. For example, the recent increase in trade and the similar climate in which WP4P for the EU market are grown in China indicates that this may be an important source of new invaders, but this was not suggested by our analysis. Moreover, most pest species in our database are recorded in one or more EU countries and the risk of these species primarily comes from within the EU. Future studies should therefore take the potential spread and establishment of these species in Europe, as well as recent changes in world trade patterns into account. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

abstract = {We study the duopolistic interaction between two monopolists located in two different countries who sell an imperfect substitute good in two markets. The traded good is transported between the two nations on ships using solid wood packing materials (SWPMs) and hence the presence of one or more invasive species is a problem. We use a game model to analyze this interaction in three steps. First, we study the benchmark case of autarky or no trade between the two nations. Second, we introduce transport costs and then study the effect of free trade on the profits of the two monopolists. Finally, we suppose that invasive species are present in the SWPMs. This fact requires compliance with an environmental protocol. We model this compliance by increasing the transport costs associated with trade and then demonstrate that a version of the so called Porter hypothesis holds. In other words, we show that compliance with a cost increasing environmental protocol can give rise to higher profits for the two monopolists under consideration.},

abstract = {A great many tools have been developed for supervised clas- sification, ranging from early methods such as linear discriminant anal- ysis through to modern developments such as neural networks and sup- port vector machines. A large number of comparative studies have been conducted in attempts to establish the relative superiority of these methods. This paper argues that these comparisons often fail to take into account important aspects of real problems, so that the apparent superiority of more sophisticated methods may be something of an illu- sion. In particular, simple methods typically yield performance almost as good asmore sophisticatedmethods, to the extent that the difference in performance may be swamped by other sources of uncertainty that generally are not considered in the classical supervised classification paradigm.},

Here, we review the likelihood of continued changes in terrestrial climate, including analyses of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project global climate model ensemble. Inertia toward continued emissions creates potential 21st-century global warming that is comparable in magnitude to that of the largest global changes in the past 65 million years but is orders of magnitude more rapid. The rate of warming implies a velocity of climate change and required range shifts of up to several kilometers per year, raising the prospect of daunting challenges for ecosystems, especially in the context of extensive land use and degradation, changes in frequency and severity of extreme events, and interactions with other stresses.},

@article{Phillips2018,
abstract = {Pest risk analysts frequently ask if the climate of a pest risk analysis area could be suitable for the establishment of an organism of concern. Species distribution models can help to answer this question, but constructing them is technically complex, time consuming, and uninformative for additional non-modelled species. A quicker more broadly applicable approach involves using environmental distance metrics, including climate matching algorithms such as the `match climates regional' function of CLIMEX (CLIMEX-MCR), to generate indices of climatic similarity between different locations without reference to particular species. Several studies have shown that various environmental distance metrics can provide biologically meaningful results. However, the veracity of the CLIMEX-MCR algorithm remains unevaluated, despite its application in numerous published studies. We used CLIMEX-MCR and high resolution New Zealand climate data to measure climatic similarities between New Zealand and the rest of the world. We then tested the veracity of the climatic match estimates by evaluating if their predictions regarding the suitability of New Zealand's climate for 43 non-native ant species corresponded with empirical observations of those species in New Zealand. Non-native ants that are, or were once, established outdoors in New Zealand had overseas distributions that were climatically well matched with New Zealand. In contrast, species that either are established only indoors in New Zealand, or were observed to temporarily nest outdoors then die in New Zealand, had overseas distributions that were poorly matched. Species that are frequently intercepted at New Zealand's border, but are not established there, generally also had overseas distributions with low climatic similarities to New Zealand. We also measured climatic similarities between New Zealand's 13 national parks and the rest of the world. The overseas distributions of the non-native ants showed poor climatic matches with New Zealand's national parks, which was consistent with the absence of persistent outdoor non-native ant populations in those parks. Our results support the utility of CLIMEX-MCR algorithm for pest risk analysis.},

Models are often incorporated in the decision-making framework of expert systems in which their limitations may be hidden. Government spending cuts and cost recovery policies in some countries force vigorous promotion of management systems by scientific advisory staff. Such uses can lead to unreasonable claims and expectations about the realism of answers provided by models. Here, the definition of a model is reviewed, a brief history of model uses in ecology is presented, and the limitations of such uses are discussed. In pest management, the very real benefits and dangers of using models will not be fully appreciated until objectives are clarified and limitations of specific models are discussed openly in published work.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd. Aim: We introduce a high-quality global database of established alien amphibians and reptiles. We use this data set to analyse: (1) the global distribution; (2) the temporal dynamics; (3) the flows between native and alien ranges; and (4) the key drivers of established alien amphibians and reptiles. Location: Worldwide. Methods: We collected geographical records of established amphibians and reptiles from a thorough search across a wide number of sources. We supplemented these data with year of first record, when available. We used descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to analyse taxonomic, spatial and temporal patterns in establishment records and the global flows of alien species. We used generalized linear mixed models to relate spatial variation in the number of established species richness with variables describing geographical, environmental and human factors. Results: Our database covers 86{\%} of the terrestrial area of the world. We identified 78 alien amphibian and 198 alien reptile species established in at least one of our 359 study regions. These figures represent about 1.0{\%} of the extant global amphibian and 1.9{\%} of the extant global reptile species richness. The flows of amphibians were dominated by exchanges between and within North and South America, and within Europe (59{\%} of all links). For reptiles, the network of global flows of established alien species was much more diverse, with every continental region being both a donor and a recipient of similar importance. The number of established alien amphibians and reptiles has grown slowly until 1950 and strongly increased thereafter. Our generalized linear mixed models revealed that insularity, climatic conditions, and socio-economic development significantly influenced the distributional patterns for both groups. Main conclusions: We conclude that biological invasions by alien amphibians and reptiles are a rapidly accelerating phenomenon, particularly on islands with heterogeneous climates of economically highly developed countries.},

abstract = {This paper examines how to obtain species biplots in unconstrained or constrained ordination without resorting to the Euclidean distance [used in principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA)] or the chi-square distance [preserved in correspondence analysis (CA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)] which are not always appropriate for the analysis of community composition data. To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environ- {\$}\backslash{\$}nmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another application allows the use of species data in other methods of multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function; an example is K-means partitioning.},

abstract = {Mediterranean climate is found on five continents and supports five global biodiversity hotspots. Based on combined downscaled results from 23 atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) for three emissions scenarios, we determined the projected spatial shifts in the mediterranean climate extent (MCE) over the next century. Although most AOGCMs project a moderate expansion in the global MCE, regional impacts are large and uneven. The median AOGCM simulation output for the three emissions scenarios project the MCE at the end of the 21(st) century in Chile will range from 129-153{\%} of its current size, while in Australia, it will contract to only 77-49{\%} of its current size losing an area equivalent to over twice the size of Portugal. Only 4{\%} of the land area within the current MCE worldwide is in protected status (compared to a global average of 12{\%} for all biome types), and, depending on the emissions scenario, only 50-60{\%} of these protected areas are likely to be in the future MCE. To exacerbate the climate impact, nearly one third (29-31{\%}) of the land where the MCE is projected to remain stable has already been converted to human use, limiting the size of the potential climate refuges and diminishing the adaptation potential of native biota. High conversion and low protection in projected stable areas make Australia the highest priority region for investment in climate-adaptation strategies to reduce the threat of climate change to the rich biodiversity of the mediterranean biome.},

abstract = {The Mediterranean basin is considered a hotspot of biological diversity with a long history of modification of natural ecosystems by human activities, and is one of the regions that will face extensive changes in climate. For 181 terrestrial mammals (68{\%} of all Mediterranean mammals), we used an ensemble forecasting approach to model the future (approx. 2100) potential distribution under climate change considering five climate change model outputs for two climate scenarios. Overall, a substantial number of Mediterranean mammals will be severely threatened by future climate change, particularly endemic species. Moreover, we found important changes in potential species richness owing to climate change, with some areas (e.g. montane region in central Italy) gaining species, while most of the region will be losing species (mainly Spain and North Africa). Existing protected areas (PAs) will probably be strongly influenced by climate change, with most PAs in Africa, the Middle East and Spain losing a substantial number of species, and those PAs gaining species (e.g. central Italy and southern France) will experience a substantial shift in species composition.},

The study was carried out by using long-term water quality monitoring data. The advantages of SOM algorithm and its classification and visualization ability for large environmental data sets are stressed. The results obtained allowed detecting natural clusters of monitoring locations with similar water quality type and identifying important discriminant variables responsible for the clustering. SOM clustering allows simultaneous observation of both spatial and temporal changes in water quality. The chemometric approach revealed different patterns of monitoring sites conditionally named "tributary", "urban", "rural" or "background". This objective separation could lead to an optimization of river monitoring nets and to a better tracing natural and anthropogenic changes along the river stream.},

The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overview of pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques, and identify cross-cutting themes and recent advances. We also describe some important applications of clustering algorithms such as image segmentation, object recognition, and information retrieval.},

abstract = {Environmental decision-making is extremely complex due to the intricacy of the systems considered and the competing interests of multiple stakeholders. Additional research is needed to acquire further knowledge and understanding of different types of uncertainty (e.g., knowledge, variability, decision, and linguistic uncertainty) inherent in environmental decision-making, and how these areas of uncertainty affect the quality of decisions rendered. Modeling and decision support tools (e.g., integrated assessment models, optimization algorithms, and multicriteria decision analysis tools) are being used increasingly for comparative analysis and uncertainty assessment of environmental management alternatives. If such tools are to provide effective decision support, the uncertainties associated with all aspects of the decision-making process need to be explicitly considered. However, as models become more complex to better represent integrated environmental, social and economic systems, achieving this goal becomes more difficult. Some of the important issues that need to be addressed in relation to the incorporation of uncertainty in environmental decision-making processes include: (1) the development of methods for quantifying the uncertainty associated with human input; (2) the development of appropriate risk-based performance criteria that are understood and accepted by a range of disciplines; (3) improvement of fuzzy environmental decision-making through the development of hybrid approaches (e.g., fuzzy-rule-based models combined with probabilistic data-driven techniques); (4) development of methods for explicitly conveying uncertainties in environmental decision-making through the use of Bayesian probability theory; (5) incorporating adaptive management practices into the environmental decision-making process, including model divergence correction; (6) the development of approaches and strategies for increasing the computational efficiency of integrated models, optimization methods, and methods for estimating risk-based performance measures; and (7) the development of integrated frameworks for comprehensively addressing uncertainty as part of the environmental decision-making process.},

abstract = {Plant assemblages define vegetation patterns at different scales, from plant communities at the scale of small plots to broad biomes. Species assemblages are traditionally investigated with a focus on native species, and the spatial patterns and dynamics of alien species assemblages have received much less attention. Here, we explore the biogeography of a subset of invasive alien plants (IAPs) in South Africa and derive several "alien biomes" based on the alien plant assemblages and associated environmental drivers. We propose six hypotheses (the Weed-Shaped Hole; the Biome Decides; Goldilocks; a New World Order; Something In The Way You Move; and Random Tessellation) based on different drivers (disturbance, competition, climate, global change, introduction dynamics, and null respectively) that might explain distribution patterns. In particular, we explore whether invasive plant assemblages are controlled by the same fundamental factors that define native plant assemblages and biomes. A cluster analysis of the spatial distribution of 69 invasive alien plant species revealed five clearly delineated geographic clusters, three of them significantly aligned with the distribution of vegetation biomes (fynbos, grassland and savanna). The major determinants of the distribution of IAP clusters were identified based on a classification tree analysis. We found that broad environmental variables, especially vegetation biomes, explained the distribution of IAP clusters (60{\%} classification accuracy). We could not find a strong relationship with anthropogenic factors, such as land cover or anthromes, even at a finer scale. Our results indicate that vegetation biomes are characterised by hard environmental barriers which also constrain the distribution of IAPs in South Africa. This supports the development of biome-level strategies for the control of alien plant species in South Africa.},

abstract = {We modeled the effects of climate change and two forest management scenarios on wood production and forest carbon balance in French forests using process-based models of forest growth. We combined data from the national forest inventory and soil network survey, which were aggregated over a 50 x 50-km grid, i.e., the spatial resolution of the climate scenario data. We predicted and analyzed the climate impact on potential forest production over the period 1960-2100. All models predicted a slight increase in potential forest yield until 2030-2050, followed by a plateau or a decline around 2070-2100, with overall, a greater increase in yield in northern France than in the south. Gross and net primary productivities were more negatively affected by soil water and atmospheric water vapor saturation deficits in western France because of a more pronounced shift in seasonal rainfall from summer to winter. The rotation-averaged values of carbon flux and production for different forest management options were estimated during four years (1980, 2015, 2045 and 2080). Predictions were made using a two-dimensional matrix covering the range of local soil and climate conditions. The changes in ecosystem fluxes and forest production were explained by the counterbalancing effect of rising CO2 concentration and increasing water deficit. The effect of climate change decreased with rotation length from short rotations with high production rates and low standing biomasses to long rotations with low productivities and greater standing biomasses. Climate effects on productivity, both negative and positive, were greatest on high fertility sites. Forest productivity in northern France was enhanced by climate change, increasingly from west to east, whereas in the southwestern Atlantic region, productivity was reduced by climate change to an increasing degree from west to east.},

abstract = {Two artificial neural networks (ANNs), unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms, were applied to suggest practical approaches for the analysis of ecological data. Four major aquatic insect orders (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and Coleoptera, i.e. EPTC), and four environmental variables (elevation, stream order, distance from the source, and water temperature) were used to implement the models. The data were collected and measured at 155 sampling sites on streams of the Adour–Garonne drainage basin (South-western France). The modelling procedure was carried out following two steps. First, a self-organizing map (SOM), an unsupervised ANN, was applied to classify sampling sites using EPTC richness. Second, a backpropagation algorithm (BP), a supervised ANN, was applied to predict EPTC richness using a set of four environmental variables. The trained SOM classified sampling sites according to a gradient of EPTC richness, and the groups obtained corresponded to geographic regions of the drainage basin and characteristics of their environmental variables. The SOM showed its convenience to analyze relationships among sampling sites, biological attributes, and environmental variables. After accounting for the relationships in data sets, the BP used to predict the EPTC richness with a set of four environmental variables showed a high accuracy (r=0.91 and r=0.61 for training and test data sets respectively). The prediction of EPTC richness is thus a valuable tool to assess disturbances in given areas: by knowing what the EPTC richness should be, we can determine the degree to which disturbances have altered it. The results suggested that methodologies successively using two different neural networks are helpful to understand ecological data through ordination first, and then to predict target variables.},

abstract = {Generally accepted standards for testing and validating ecosystem models would benefit both modellers and model users. Universally applicable test procedures are difficult to prescribe, given the diversity of modelling approaches and the many uses for models. However, the generally accepted scientific principles of documentation and disclosure provide a useful framework for devising general standards for model evaluation. Adequately documenting model tests requires explicit performance criteria, and explicit benchmarks against which model performance is compared. A model's validity, reliability, and accuracy can be most meaningfully judged by explicit comparison against the available alternatives. In contrast, current practice is often characterized by vague, subjective claims that model predictions show 'acceptable' agreement with data; such claims provide little basis for choosing among alternative models. Strict model tests (those that invalid models are unlikely to pass) are the only ones capable of convincing rational skeptics that a model is probably valid. However, 'false positive' rates as low as 10{\%} can substantially erode the power of validation tests, making them insufficiently strict to convince rational skeptics. Validation tests are often undermined by excessive parameter calibration and overuse of ad hoc model features. Tests are often also divorced from the conditions under which a model will be used, particularly when it is designed to forecast beyond the range of historical experience. In such situations, data from laboratory and field manipulation experiments can provide particularly effective tests, because one can create experimental conditions quite different from historical data, and because experimental data can provide a more precisely defined 'target' for the model to hit. We present a simple demonstration showing that the two most common methods for comparing model predictions to environmental time series (plotting model time series against data time series, and plotting predicted versus observed values) have little diagnostic power. We propose that it may be more useful to statistically extract the relationships of primary interest from the time series, and test the model directly against them.},

abstract = {Biological invasions are a global phenomenon that threatens biodiversity, and few, if any, ecosystems are free from alien species. The outcome of human-mediated introductions is affected by the invasiveness of species and invasibility of ecosystems, but research has primarily focused on defining, characterizing and identifying invasive species; ecosystem invasibility has received much less attention. A prerequisite for characterizing invasibility is the ability to compare levels of invasion across ecosystems. In this paper, we aim to identify the best way to quantify the level of invasion by nonnative animals and plants by reviewing the advantages and disadvantages of different metrics. We explore how interpretation and choice of these measures can depend on the objective of a study or management intervention. Based on our review, we recommend two invasion indices and illustrate their use by applying them to two case studies. Relative alien species richness and relative alien species abundance indicate the contribution that alien species make to a community. They are easy to measure, can be applied to various taxa, are independent of scale and are comparable across regions and ecosystems, and historical data are often available. The relationship between relative alien richness and abundance can indicate the presence of dominant alien species and the trajectory of invasion over time, and can highlight ecosystems and sites that are heavily invaded or especially susceptible to invasion. Splitting species into functional groups and examining invasion patterns of transformer species may be particularly instructive for gauging effects of alien invasion on ecosystem structure and function. Establishing standard, transparent ways to define and quantify invasion level will facilitate meaningful comparisons among studies, ecosystem types and regions. It is essential for progress in ecology and will help guide ecosystem restoration and management.},

abstract = {1. Despite the abundance, richness and ecological importance of insects, distribution patterns remain unknown for most groups, and this creates serious diffi- culties for the evaluation of macroecological patterns and the underlying drivers. Although the problem is real, we provide an optimistic perspective on insect macroe- cology and conservation biogeography. 2. Although data for macroecological analysis of insects are not as complete as for many other organisms (e.g., mammals and birds), at least for some insect groups they are equivalent to what existed 10 or 20 years ago for the charismatic mega- fauna, so initiatives to compile data for broad-scale analyses are feasible. 3. The primary constraint for studies in insect macroecology and conservation biogeography is not (only) poor data; part of the problem arises from a lack of knowledge on how macroecological patterns and processes can be analysed and interpreted. 4. Finally, we present an overview of recent papers using insects as model organ- isms in macroecology, including richness and diversity gradients, ecogeographical rules, inter-specific relationships, conservation planning and modelling species distri- butions. Although our list is not exhaustive, it may be useful as guidelines for future research and encourage ICD readers to develop analyses for other insect groups.},

abstract = {The literature on biological invasions is biased in favour of invasive species--those that spread and often reach high abundance following introduction by humans. It is, however, also important to understand previous stages in the introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum ('the continuum'), especially the factors that mediate naturalization. The emphasis on invasiveness is partly because most invasions are only recognized once species occupy large adventive ranges or start to spread. Also, many studies lump all alien species, and fail to separate introduced, naturalized and invasive populations and species. These biases impede our ability to elucidate the full suite of drivers of invasion and to predict invasion dynamics, because different factors mediate progression along different sections of the continuum. A better understanding of the determinants of naturalization is important because all naturalized species are potential invaders. Processes leading to naturalization act differently in different regions and global biogeographical patterns of plant invasions result from the interaction of population-biological, macroecological and human-induced factors. We explore what is known about how determinants of naturalization in plants interact at various scales, and how their importance varies along the continuum. Research that is explicitly linked to particular stages of the continuum can generate new information that is appropriate for improving the management of biological invasions if, for example, potentially invasive species are identified before they exert an impact.},

An important yet unresolved question is whether all herbivore populations are equally able to utilize new host plants or if populations may be geographically structured, that is only a subset has the potential to undergo a host range expansion and become widely invasive. We examined if derived and ancestral geographic populations of L.decemlineata or Colorado potato beetle, varied in host preference and performance on both wild (Solanum rostratum) and cultivated (Solanum tuberosum) host plants. Sampling from six different North American regions (3 ancestral and 2 derived), we performed two full-factorial experiments to test for differences in host preference, acceptance, and performance on S. rostraum and S. tuberosum. Our results reveal the development of new (cultivated) host associations within pest populations of L. decemlineata following its geographic expansion. Pest beetles (i.e., Vermont populations) discriminated less between host plants and grew faster than all other beetle population on both host species. The Vermont beetles also developed faster on leaves than all other populations. The greater general preference, acceptance, and performance of Vermont beetles on all host types underscores the virulence of the pest form of the beetle and may help to explain the absence of pest incidence within the ancestral regions of L. decemlineata.},

abstract = {Land cover maps provide essential input data for various hydromorphological and ecological models, but the effect of land cover classification errors on these models has not been quantified systematically. This paper presents the uncertainty in hydromorphological and ecological model output for a large lowland river depending on the classification accuracy (CA) of a land cover map. Using four different models, we quantified the uncertainty for the three distributaries of the Rhine River in The Netherlands with respect to: (1) hydrodynamics (WAQUA model), (2) annual average suspended sediment deposition (SEDIFLUX model), (3) ecotoxicological hazards of contaminated sediment for a bird of prey, and (4) floodplain importance for desired habitat types and species (BIO-SAFE model). We carried out two Monte Carlo (n = 15) analyses: one at a 69{\{}{\%}{\}} land cover CA, the other at 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CA. Subsequently we ran all four models with the 30 realizations as input.The error in the current land cover map gave an uncertainty in design water levels of up to 19 cm. Overbank sediment deposition varied up to 100{\{}{\%}{\}} in the area bordering the main channel, but when aggregated to the whole study area, the variation in sediment trapping efficiency was negligible. The ecotoxicological hazards, represented by the fraction of Little Owl habitat with potential cadmium exposure levels exceeding a corresponding toxicity threshold of 148 ??g d-1, varied between 54 and 60{\{}{\%}{\}}, aggregated over the distributaries. The 68{\{}{\%}{\}} confidence interval of floodplain importance for protected and endangered species varied between 10 and 15{\{}{\%}{\}}. Increasing the classification accuracy to 95{\{}{\%}{\}} significantly lowered the uncertainty of all models applied. Compared to landscaping measures, the effects due to the uncertainty in the land cover map are of the same order of magnitude. Given high financial costs of these landscaping measures, increasing the classification accuracy of land cover maps is a prerequisite for improving the assessment of the efficiency of landscaping measures. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The combination of results from different large-scale datasets of multidimensional biological signals (such as gene expression profiling) presents a major challenge. Methodologies are needed that can efficiently combine diverse datasets, but can also test the extent of diversity (heterogeneity) across the combined studies. We developed METa-analysis of RAnked DISCovery datasets (METRADISC), a generalized meta-analysis method for combining information across discovery-oriented datasets and for testing between-study heterogeneity for each biological variable of interest. The method is based on non-parametric Monte Carlo permutation testing. The tested biological variables are ranked in each study according to the level of statistical significance. METRADISC tests for each biological variable of interest its average rank and the between-study heterogeneity of the study-specific ranks. After accounting for ties and differences in tested variables across studies, we randomly permute the ranks of each study and the simulated metrics of average rank and heterogeneity are calculated. The procedure is repeated to generate null distributions for the metrics. The use of METRADISC is demonstrated empirically using gene expression data from seven studies comparing prostate cancer cases and normal controls. We offer a new tool for combining complex datasets derived from massive testing, discovery-oriented research and for examining the diversity of results across the combined studies.},

Predicting which one in hundreds of potential invasive fruit fly species is most likely to establish in a region presents a significant challenge, but can be facilitated using a self organising map (SOM), which is able to analyse species associations to rank large numbers of species simultaneously with an index of establishment. A global presence/absence dataset including 180 economically significant fruit fly species in 118 countries was analysed using a SOM. We compare and contrast ranked lists from six countries selected from each continent, and also show that those countries geographically close were clustered together by the SOM analysis because they have similar fruit fly assemblages. These closely clustered countries therefore represent greater threats to each other as sources of invasive fruit fly species. Finally, we indicate how this SOM method could be utilized as an initial screen to support prioritizing fruit fly species for further research into their potential to invade a region.},

Spread is facilitated primarily by human transportation, but there is increasing concern that climate change allows establishment in hitherto unsuitable regions. However, interactions between climate change, crops and pests are complex, and the extent to which crop pests and pathogens have altered their latitudinal ranges in response to global warming is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate an average poleward shift of 2.7±0.8 km yr−1 since 1960, in observations of hundreds of pests and pathogens, but with significant variation in trends among taxonomic groups. Observational bias, where developed countries at high latitudes detect pests earlier than developing countries at low latitudes, would result in an apparent shift towards the Equator. The observed positive latitudinal trends in many taxa support the hypothesis of global warming-driven pest movement.},

abstract = {Many emerging invasive species display evidence of rapid adaptation. Contemporary genetic studies demonstrate that adaptation to novel environments can occur within 20 generations or less, indicating that evolutionary processes can influence invasiveness. However, the source of genetic or epigenetic variation underlying these changes remains uncharacterised. Here, we review the potential for rapid adaptation from standing genetic variation and from new mutations, and examine four types of evolutionary change that might promote or constrain rapid adaptation during the invasion process. Understanding the source of variation that contributes to adaptive evolution in invasive plants is important for predicting future invasion scenarios, identifying candidate genes involved in invasiveness, and, more generally, for understanding how populations can evolve rapidly in response to novel and changing environments. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Successful latitudinal expansions into temperate climates depend largely upon the evolution of novel adaptive traits or the presence of pre-adaptive or exapted mechanisms for survival in seasonal climates. Geographic comparisons of ancestral (pre-expansion) and derived (post-expansion) populations provide a useful framework for understanding the evolutionary conditions that facilitate geographic expansions. Using a common agricultural pest, the Colorado Potato Beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) as a model, we conducted a regional comparison of cold hardiness and overwintering success among ancestral (southern Mexico) and derived (Vermont and Kansas, USA) L. decemlineata populations. In order to determine if ancestral and derived beetle populations vary physiologically for cold hardiness, we compared supercooling points (SCPs) of three geographic populations of L. decemlineata. We also tested if ancestral and derived beetle populations differed in their overwintering behavior and success by performing an overwintering field experiment. Ancestral and derived populations did not express different physiological responses (i.e. SCPs) to freezing temperatures. However, ancestral and derived populations responded differently to the onset of winter conditions and displayed dissimilar overwintering behaviors. The majority of ancestral beetles failed to initiate diapause and dug upward within experimental mesocosms. Differences in overwintering behavior also resulted in significant variation in overwintering success as derived populations displayed higher overwintering survivorship when compared with ancestral populations. Given our results, it is evident that research exploring the interaction of the ecological factors and evolutionary processes is necessary to fully realize the dynamics of biological invasions.},

abstract = {Land cover maps provide essential input data for various hydromorphological and ecological models, but the effect of land cover classification errors on these models has not been quantified systematically. This paper presents the uncertainty in hydromorphological and ecological model output for a large lowland river depending on the classification accuracy (CA) of a land cover map. Using four different models, we quantified the uncertainty for the three distributaries of the Rhine River in The Netherlands with respect to: (1) hydrodynamics (WAQUA model), (2) annual average suspended sediment deposition (SEDIFLUX model), (3) ecotoxicological hazards of contaminated sediment for a bird of prey, and (4) floodplain importance for desired habitat types and species (BIO-SAFE model). We carried out two Monte Carlo (n = 15) analyses: one at a 69{\%} land cover CA, the other at 95{\%} CA. Subsequently we ran all four models with the 30 realizations as input.The error in the current land cover map gave an uncertainty in design water levels of up to 19 cm. Overbank sediment deposition varied up to 100{\%} in the area bordering the main channel, but when aggregated to the whole study area, the variation in sediment trapping efficiency was negligible. The ecotoxicological hazards, represented by the fraction of Little Owl habitat with potential cadmium exposure levels exceeding a corresponding toxicity threshold of 148 ??g d-1, varied between 54 and 60{\%}, aggregated over the distributaries. The 68{\%} confidence interval of floodplain importance for protected and endangered species varied between 10 and 15{\%}. Increasing the classification accuracy to 95{\%} significantly lowered the uncertainty of all models applied. Compared to landscaping measures, the effects due to the uncertainty in the land cover map are of the same order of magnitude. Given high financial costs of these landscaping measures, increasing the classification accuracy of land cover maps is a prerequisite for improving the assessment of the efficiency of landscaping measures. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Its exponent q is expressed as a function q(??) of the Renyi parameter ??. The difference between the Renyi and Boltzmann-Shannon entropies (a modified Lyapunov functional ??R) for the same power-law distribution is negative and as a function of ?? has a well-defined minimum at ??* which remains within the narrow range from 1.5 to 3 when varying other characteristic parameters of any concrete systems. Relevant variations of the exponent q(??*) are found within the range 1-3.5. The same range of observable values of q is typical for the various applications where the power-law distribution takes place. It is known under the following names: `triangular or trapezoidal' (in physics and technics), `Gutenberg-Richter law' (in geophysics), `Zipf-Pareto law' (in economics and the humanities), `Lotka low' (in science of science), etc. As the negative ??R indicates self-organization of the system, the negative minimum of ??R corresponds to the most self-organized state. Thus, the comparison between the calculated range of variations of q(??*) and observable values of the exponent q testifies that the most self-organized states are as a rule realized regardless of the nature of a chaotic system.},

abstract = {Aim Australian acacias (1012 recognized species native to Australia, which were previously grouped in Acacia subgenus Phyllodineae) have been moved extensively around the world by humans over the past 250 years. This has created the opportunity to explore how evolutionary, ecological, historical and sociological factors interact to affect the distribution, usage, invasiveness and perceptions of a globally important group of plants. This editorial provides the background for the 20 papers in this special issue of Diversity and Distributions that focusses on the global cross-disciplinary experiment of introduced Australian acacias. Location Australia and global. Methods The papers of the special issue are discussed in the context of a unified framework for biological invasions. Distributions of species were mapped across Australia, their representation in bioclimatic zones examined and the potential global distribution of the group modelled. By collating a variety of different lists, we determined which Australian acacias have reached different stages in the introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum in different parts of the world. Paradigms and key research questions relating to barriers to invasion, stages of invasion and management perceptions are sketched. Results According to our global database of Australian acacia records, 386 species have been moved outside Australia by human agency, 71 species are naturalized or weedy, and 23 are unequivocally invasive. Climatic models suggest that about a third of the world's land surface is climatically suitable for Australian acacias. Many species are commercially important crops or are useful for other purposes and have been extensively planted, and many different human perceptions of Australian acacias exist in different parts of the world. The papers in the special issue cover all the barriers, stages and processes that define biological invasions and touch on many aspects: history and the human dimension; aspects of the species pool; species traits; biotic interactions; climate and niche; and management. Main conclusions Australian acacias are an excellent model group for examining interactions between evolutionary, ecological and socio-economic drivers of species introductions. New insights have emerged on the biological, ecological and evolutionary correlates of naturalization and invasion, but human usage factors permeate all explanatory models. Understanding and managing introduced Australian acacias requires a fundamental and integrative appreciation of both intrinsic (e.g. species traits) and extrinsic (e.g. human usage and perceptions) aspects.},

abstract = {Global species extinction rates are orders of magnitude above the background rate documented in the fossil record. However, recent data syntheses have found mixed evidence for patterns of net species loss at local spatial scales. For example, two recent data meta-analyses have found that species richness is decreasing in some locations and is increasing in others. When these trends are combined, these papers argued there has been no net change in species richness, and suggested this pattern is globally representative of biodiversity change at local scales. Here we re-analyze results of these data syntheses and outline why this conclusion is unfounded. First, we show the datasets collated for these syntheses are spatially biased and not representative of the spatial distribution of species richness or the distribution of many primary drivers of biodiversity change. This casts doubt that their results are representative of global patterns. Second, we argue that detecting the trend in local species richness is very difficult with short time series and can lead to biased estimates of change. Re-analyses of the data detected a signal of study duration on biodiversity change, indicating net biodiversity loss is most apparent in studies of longer duration. Third, estimates of species richness change can be biased if species gains during post-disturbance recovery are included without also including species losses that occurred during the disturbance. Net species gains or losses should be assessed with respect to common baselines or reference communities. Ultimately, we need a globally coordinated effort to monitor biodiversity so that we can estimate and attribute human impacts as causes of biodiversity change. A combination of technologies will be needed to produce regularly updated global datasets of local biodiversity change to guide future policy. At this time the conclusion that there is no net change in local species richness is not the consensus state of knowledge.},

We found that by 2080, 58 ± 2.6{\%} of the species would lose suitable climate in protected areas, whereas losses affected 63 ± 2.1{\%} of the species of European concern occurring in Natura 2000 areas. Protected areas are expected to retain climatic suitability for species better than unprotected areas (P {\textless} 0.001), but Natura 2000 areas retain climate suitability for species no better and sometimes less effectively than unprotected areas. The risk is high that ongoing efforts to conserve Europe's biodiversity are jeopardized by climate change. New policies are required to avert this risk.},

abstract = {Protecting national borders against biological invasions is becoming increasingly difficult because those whose actions result in invasions seldom bear legal responsibility for those actions. Invasion costs are often an externality (an unintended side effect) of international trade. Externalities are best dealt with by internalizing them; that is, by getting those who harm society to meet the cost. This is the 'polluter pays principle', which, under current trade rules, is difficult to implement. Tariffs could, however, be used to confront exporters with the costs of their actions, and the right to do this should be embedded in trade agreements. At the same time, international aid could be used to protect donor societies against the inability of some other countries to take appropriate biosecurity measures. The impact of invasions can thus be reduced by tackling their economic externalities.},

It has the appealing property of being objec- tive, requiring no subjective input from the user. On the other hand, the AUC has disadvantages, some of which are well known. For example, the AUC can give potentially misleading results if ROC curves cross. However, the AUC also has a much more serious deficiency, and one which appears not to have been previously recognised. This is that it is fundamentally incoherent in terms of misclassification costs: the AUC uses different misclassification cost distributions for different classifiers. This means that using the AUC is equivalent to using different metrics to evaluate different classification rules. It is equivalent to saying that, using one classifier, misclassifying a class 1 point is p times as serious as misclassifying a class 0 point, but, using another classifier, misclassifying a class 1 point is P times as serious, where p ?= P. This is nonsensical because the relative severities of different kinds of misclassifications of individual points is a property of the problem, not the classifiers which happen to have been chosen. This property is explored in detail, and a simple valid alternative to the AUC is proposed.},

abstract = {Environmental decision-making is extremely complex due to the intricacy of the systems considered and the competing interests of multiple stakeholders. Additional research is needed to acquire further knowledge and understanding of different types of uncertainty (e.g., knowledge, variability, decision, and linguistic uncertainty) inherent in environmental decision-making, and how these areas of uncertainty affect the quality of decisions rendered. Modeling and decision support tools (e.g., integrated assessment models, optimization algorithms, and multicriteria decision analysis tools) are being used increasingly for comparative analysis and uncertainty assessment of environmental management alternatives. If such tools are to provide effective decision support, the uncertainties associated with all aspects of the decision-making process need to be explicitly considered. However, as models become more complex to better represent integrated environmental, social and economic systems, achieving this goal becomes more difficult. Some of the important issues that need to be addressed in relation to the incorporation of uncertainty in environmental decision-making processes include: (1) the development of methods for quantifying the uncertainty associated with human input; (2) the development of appropriate risk-based performance criteria that are understood and accepted by a range of disciplines; (3) improvement of fuzzy environmental decision-making through the development of hybrid approaches (e.g., fuzzy-rule-based models combined with probabilistic data-driven techniques); (4) development of methods for explicitly conveying uncertainties in environmental decision-making through the use of Bayesian probability theory; (5) incorporating adaptive management practices into the environmental decision-making process, including model divergence correction; (6) the development of approaches and strategies for increasing the computational efficiency of integrated models, optimization methods, and methods for estimating risk-based performance measures; and (7) the development of integrated frameworks for comprehensively addressing uncertainty as part of the environmental decision-making process.},

abstract = {Active adaptive management balances the requirements of management with the need to learn about the system being managed, which leads to better decisions. It is difficult to judge the benefit of management actions that accelerate information gain, relative to the benefit of making the best management decision given what is known at the time. We present a first step in developing methods to optimize management decisions that incorporate both uncertainty and learning via adaptive management. We assumed a manager can allocate effort to discrete units (e.g., areas for revegetation or animals for reintroduction), the outcome can be measured as success or failure (e.g., the revegetation in an area is successful or the animal survives and breeds), and the manager has two possible management options from which to choose. We further assumed that there is an annual budget that may be allocated to one or both of the two options and that the manager must decide on the allocation. We used Bayesian updating of the probability of success of the two options and stochastic dynamic programming to determine the optimal strategy over a specified number of years. The costs, level of certainty about the success of the two options, and the timeframe of management all influenced the optimal allocation of the annual budget. In addition, the choice of management objective had a large influence on the optimal decision. In a case study of Merri Creek, Melbourne, Australia, we applied the approach to determining revegetation strategies. Our approach can be used to determine how best to manage ecological systems in the face of uncertainty.},

abstract = {In this article, we introduce a conceptual framework for systematic identification and assessment of sources of uncertainty in simulation models. This concept builds on a novel typology of uncertainty in model validation and extends the GIScience research focus on uncertainty in spatial data to uncertainty in simulation modelling. Such a concept helps a modeller to interpret and handle uncertainty in order to efficiently optimise a model and better understand simulation results. To illustrate our approach, we apply the proposed framework for uncertainty assessment to the TREE LIne Model (TREELIM), an individual-based model that simulates forest succession at the alpine tree line. Using this example, uncertainty is identified in the modelling workflow during conceptualisation, formalisation, parameterisation, analysis and validation. With help of a set of indicators we quantify the emerging uncertainties and assess the overall model uncertainty as a function of all occurring sources of uncertainty. An understanding of the sources of uncertainty in an ecological model proves beneficial for: (1) developing a structurally valid model in a systematic way; (2) deciding if further refinement of the conceptual model is beneficial for the modelling purpose; and (3) interpreting the overall model uncertainty by understanding its sources. Our approach results in a guideline for assessing uncertainty in the validation of simulation models in a feasible and defensible way, and thus functions as a toolbox for modellers. We consider this work as a contribution towards a general concept of uncertainty in spatially explicit simulation models.},
